<p>You may have spotted ribbons on the top right (or even, horror of horrors, on the top left) of some webpages. The trend started with charity ads but now loads of sites use them to link out to related content. Well the fabulous peeps at Quick Ribbon will make (and host) yours for you for free. Check out mine on the <a href="https://ellis.scot/">homepage</a> (I've taken advantage of it to link out to my <a href="http://twitter.com/jonoellis">Twitter feed</a> since I'm starting to use Twitter more and more these days).<br />
Have fun making your own.</p>
