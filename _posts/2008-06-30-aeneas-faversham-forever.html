<p>What an grand weekend I've had; drinks in Covent Garden, the Ian Fleming exhibition at the Imperial War Museum, a visit to the Tate and Aeneaus Faversham Forever... and that was just Saturday! I was pretty excited to discover that <a href="http://www.pennydreadfuls.co.uk/">The Penny Dreadfuls</a> were previewing their Fringe show at the Greenwich theatre the same weekend I was going to be in London. The show lived up to expectations with a good mix of Victoriana, steampunk, intelligence, smut and slapstick (and you should book early because <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/edinburghfestivalfringe/Edinburgh-Fringe-special-August39s-hottest.4184349.jp">they made it onto the Scotsman's list of top shows to see</a>). Judging from the audience it appears that they now have groupies!<br />
If you didn't catch them the last time that they were <a href="http://ellis.scot/2008/01/the-penny-dreadfuls-present-the-brothers-faversham/">on the gramophone</a> have no fear... they are about to record a second series of their BBC radio show so keep an ear open for them.<br />
Good luck for the Fringe guys - the Pleasance indeed!</p>
