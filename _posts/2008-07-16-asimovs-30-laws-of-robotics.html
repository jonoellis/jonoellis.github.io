<p>I've just read <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/asimov-laws-robotics.php">Asimov's 30 Laws of Robotics from Something Awful</a> and I can't believe that this hasn't been done before (and if it has, I can't believe that I haven't seen it!). Asimov's Laws of Robotics expanded to include a few more personal heuristics that robots should try to follow as well as a few put there as personal safety nets. A robot seems to make a pretty good scapegoat for all those childish pranks! I think that I would have to with Something Awful - I would definitely get my robot to answer the phone and the door during the night. The thought of having to decide who to listen to out of two humans using depth of voice only is fantastic - I think that that would solve many arguments!</p>
