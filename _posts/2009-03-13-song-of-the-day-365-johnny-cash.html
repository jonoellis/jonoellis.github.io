Johnny Cash - Folsom Prison Blues (Live from S.Quentin)<br />
Today is the 365th "Song of the day" - that's one for every day of the year so I think I'll stop there for just now. It's coincidently the 5 and a half year anniversary of Johnny Cash's death. Song of the day started with Richard singing "Ring of fire" around the office and the rest of us trying to find different music to listen to so it's only appropriate that the man in black gets to cap off a year and a half of blog posts.
