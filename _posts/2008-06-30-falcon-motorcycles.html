<p>I saw this picture in Esquire yesterday: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Lee_(entertainer)">Jason Lee</a> astride his Falcon motorbike. Now I already think that Jason Lee is a bit of a legend (not just because of "My Name's Earl" but also because of his Kevin Smith films) but this is a bike that definitely makes the man.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Motorcycles">Falcon Motorcycles</a> are an award winning custom motorcycle manufacturer specialising in recycling post war British motorcycles (which are the still some of the coolest bikes of all time) and the bikes that they create are works of art - check out the attention to detail in this rear light!</p>
<p>PS - does anyone else thing that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Jason_lee02.jpg">Jason Lee</a> looks a lot like <a href="http://earsucker.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/dave-grohl-vmas1.jpg">Dave Grohl</a>?</p>
