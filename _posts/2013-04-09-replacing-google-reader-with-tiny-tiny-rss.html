<p>When Google <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/google-discontinuing-google-reader-as-part-of-spring-cleaning/">announced</a> that they were shutting down Reader it was a bit of a surprise as it seemed to me that a lot of people that I know relied on it. It was easily my most visited site - it was where all of my most visited sites lived! Anyway, instead of dwelling on Google I set out looking for an alternative. I liked the idea of a <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/digg-puts-building-an-rss-reader-to-the-top-of-their-priority-list/">DIGG</a> product, but didn't want to wait. I think <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5991272/most-popular-google-reader-alternative-feedly">Feedly</a> would do the trick for me, but I wanted something that I could be the boss of. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5990881/five-best-google-reader-alternatives">Lifehacker</a> suggested Tiny Tiny RSS and it looked like the one for me. The installation was easy enough - <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5992404/how-to-build-your-own-syncing-rss-reader-with-tiny-tiny-rss-and-kick-google-reader-to-the-curb">the steps are all here</a>. The Android App works like a dream, even better than the way Google Reader works on Android. :) The iPad version was a little bit of hassle to find but once the digest for slate plugin was activated things were sorted. I've set it all up on a subdomain and I'm pretty happy. At the moment it only pings all of the feeds to check for new articles when I'm in a full browser (not on Android or iPad) but that's the next thing to work on.</p>
<p>I guess that I should end this post by asking "What's next on Google's kill list?" - especially since some of the most loyal users were punished it seems that no service is safe:</p>
