So many exciting things for the kid - France trip, DofE, drama shows, musical... and some fun beer festival, Arkham and socialising for me (mixed in with some crap work stuff).


* [Melora - Low Tide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSGvy_oyPHg)

	 This band are going through some tough times but they are creating some wonderful music at the same time. 


* [Bellow - Witch Bolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYbXZOjk6JA)

	 Concentration from a dungeon world. On very heavy rotation this month. 


* [Hell You Call A Dream - The Warning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6b_FgQnXL8)

	 Huge rock sounds from these sisters! HURT and MORE are also rocking.


* [A Deviation from the Ordinary - allmyfriendsaresynths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LliZvii0rJ4)

	 I love allmyfriendsaresynths channel and the music is great too. 


* [Creep (Radiohead Cover) - Erin Morton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROJZntCBZCc)

	 GOOSEBUMPS. 90s me didn't realise that Creep would be a standard. (RIP [Prince](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFXZNt4oLkE).) The original hit a billion streams on Spotify so I guess as an indicator that song alone must have made Thom and the lads a handful of milions each in royalies.


* [Take On Me (Aha Cover) - The Dregs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11aaY0kY7lM)

	 Opening with a choir was not the banjo take I was expecting!


* [I Miss You (Blink-182 Cover) - Frank Watkinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnbEBT1xUgg&)

	 I wasn't aware of the Frank Watkinson phenomenon but found it today when YouTube reminded me that I love this song in its many versions. The comments are a bit over the top but a million subscribers ain't to be sniffed at - this guy's got the skills. 


* [Stranded - Gojira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcJYyoyTDa4)

	 Reminded of this band when I heard they were Metallica support. Kinda fancied the gig but ðŸ¤‘


* [Doomsday Blue - Bambie Thug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMq8ofCstMQ)

	 A little bit of witchcraft from last year's Eurovision. 


* [Newcastle - Gout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMgbleVKVhg)

	 Sludge, punk, doom, metal, Glasgow. 


* [Sofia - Clairo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y8AEEyS20Q)

	 A song that's been on repeat on road trips. 


* [What The Hell Just Happened? - Remember Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hu6R3ZnOdY)

	 Got stuck in my head!


* [Sea Lions - Samia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxcZOmTb_u0)

	 The arpeggiator bit with the mood shift really makes this song. Bloodless is a brilliant and intriguing album - Samia's music often has some quirks of language that draw you into the abstract imagery.
