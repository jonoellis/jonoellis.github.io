<p>Well... I watched Skyfall last night. I'm not going to put any spoilers here but I will say that it's a very different film from any that has come before it. It's a really good film and even if a few things didn't feel right it was seriously good. 4 years ago almost to the day I wrote some <a href="http://ellis.scot/2008/11/james-bond-23-plot-suggestions-quantum-of-solace-review/">plot suggestions for Bond 23</a> here - so how many came together? Quite a few!</p>
<ul>
<li>Judi Dench in a starring role – check</li>
<li>Bond at home in London/the UK – check</li>
<li>More freerunning – a tiny bit... still: check</li>
<li>Active service in the Navy– nope</li>
<li>Less CGI – hmmm - mostly</li>
<li>Give a little bit more back story – check</li>
<li>A little more humour – a bit</li>
<li>More of Feilix Leiter - nope</li>
<li>More “Bond, James Bond.” – no comment</li>
<li>Training – some - not quite what I had in mind but still, a bit</li>
<li>More exciting free-time sports – nope</li>
<li>More homages – oh yeah</li>
<li>More of the gritty, serious and real feel which some of the reviewers seemed to dislike – oh yeah!</li>
<li>A little more flirtation – check</li>
<li>Technology/Gadgets – check</li>
<li>Some new locations – check</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall? This film really does deliver something different!</p>
