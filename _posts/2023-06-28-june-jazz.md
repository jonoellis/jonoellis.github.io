A great month for music - Glastonbury is a very fine thing! So great, in fact, that I'm leaving some for next month!


* [Wicked Game (Chris Isaak Cover) - Tenacious D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfz9jQ3KI5k)

	 A sub two minute cover of a classic that somehow captures the spirit of the original, captures the essence of Tenacious D and multiplies the awesome. Absolutely love this. 


* [Wembley Stadium 2008 Concert - Foo Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvrN6f95GOw&list=PLmD1X2JtvY2py2yOSVvsinVYH3TU5mBzo)

	 When the Foo Fighters played in Wembley I wasn't able to go and I had major FOMO. The Foos gig at Meadowbank was one of my favourite ever (Foos and NIN on the same stage!). I relistened to Zane Lowe's BBC highlights of the Wembley gig and felt a pang of regret that's still raw after all these years - that gig was a band at their peak. Thank you to all of the engineers and camera people who captured it! (The full BBC session isn't available but the selection of YouTube videos do a fine job).


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - The Churnups](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0frqsf3/glastonbury-foo-fighters)

	 So when I relistened to the Wembley Foo Fighters set at the start of the month I wasn't to know that the surprise band for Glasto would be the Foos. I saw an article saying it was their biggest ever crowd (100k ish people) - I don't need to verify it to know that 100k is a lot of people and that their set was a blinder. The energy was off the scale!


* [Miss Your Birthday - Teen Jesus and the Jean Teasers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB_KIFmMP-E)

	 I love hearing that this band are on the lineup for support for the Foo Fighters in Australia and New Zealand - some fab songs. 


* [What I wouldn't Do - A Fine Frenzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzKZYkZR_bU)

	 As ever, I'm a fan of discovering actors who can sing... and it turns out that Alison Sudol is a singer with a big backcatalogue that can act. 


* [I Threw Glass at my Friend's Eyes and Now I'm on Probation - Destroy Boys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UigJn6Tq-lA)

	 Lots of energy on this one! Love it.


* [THE MOST MYSTERIOUS SONG ON THE INTERNET  - Band name not known](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPGf4liO-KQ)

	 Catchy... [but who is it by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Mysterious_Song_on_the_Internet)?


* [Annabelle - Creeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6dORf4EVMc)

	 Also catchy - but in a very emo/pop-punk kind of way.


* [Life Sentence - MALEVOLENCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp_YWEsZPrU)

	 I've definitely been listening to some heavier stuff this month - this track stands out as being at the more epic end.


* [Commando highscore (Keygen) - ACME - MultiPlant II GPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_tJ9fH93m4)

	 I know little of the [keygen music scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_intro) - but this tune is amazing. 


* [Dopamine - The Arcadian Wild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4SKvWsfSDg)

	 One of those songs that you can listen to on repeat ad infinitum. 


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - Chvrches](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0fsyy41/glastonbury-chvrches)

	 In an outstanding set Miracle, Final Girl and Mother We Share were all standout tracks.


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - MÃ¥neskin](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0ft6w70/glastonbury-maneskin)

	 A very slick and passionate set. 


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - Sparks](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0ft1n54/glastonbury-sparks)

	 Cate Blanchett's dance was a very Sparks moment! And closing with All That was fab. It's fascinating to see how a band in their mid and late seventies have been reignighted (lol) by the documentary and Edgar Wright's interest.


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set Covering The Smiths - Rick Astley & Blossoms](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0ft6w7z/glastonbury-rick-astley-blossoms-perform-the-smiths)

	 Rick's own set performance was fun but somehow coming along and reclaiming much-loved songs from a much-hated frontman was a more serious and more momentous affair. Certainly more than karaoke.  How Soon Is Now and There Is a Light That Never Goes Out were next level! Also, their bass player got way too little coverage - stunning work. Also - who sets off flares inside a tent? Idiots. I'd have hated being in that tent for that reason alone.


* [That's What I Like - Kelsi Luck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmOKI_o50Eo)

	 Always a fan of cinemagraphs... and this is the first time I remember seeing them in a music video - nice idea. 


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - Pale Waves](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0ft1lnk/glastonbury-pale-waves)

	 Not a band that I'd heard of but they played a solid set. 


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - The Big Moon](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0ftbblz/glastonbury-the-big-moon)

	 A pretty joyous set.


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - Texas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0fsygtr/glastonbury-texas)

	 Five star set - choooons all the way through. 


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - Guns N' Roses](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0ft26cy/glastonbury-guns-n-roses)

	 I have this weird idea in my head that GNR are at least a decade older than they actually are. They are doing okay for 60 year-olds but my word the singing is shrill - the falsetto verse sining on Sweet Child was atrocious... and because of that they could have cut a few tracks. Or bulked out with a second singer? Slash was on fire - crazy to think of how much better the other 64 "better" ranked guitar players in the world are (according to The Rolling Stone magazine). Drums and guitar made this show.  


* [Glastonbury 2023 Set - Royal Blood](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0frqqxv/glastonbury-royal-blood)

	 Oooft! What an opener!! What a closer!! So much energy in between! I know that this band isn't quite a two-piece now but the sound they manage to wring out of those two instruments is amazing.
