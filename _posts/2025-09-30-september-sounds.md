A month of house jobs, taxiing, a mountain picnic, a #cabin minibreak, TableTop Scotland, socialising and a battle of the bands.  


* [All Day All Night - Big Thief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ypvGArgmIk)

	 Double Infinity is a gem of an album. Definitely up there for album of the year. 


* [Init - Nine Inch Nails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9D8gHY2OPE)

	 Does the album come close to matching the energy of As Alive As You Need Me To Be? No. Is it still awesome? Yes. 


* [The Water Is Wide - Keizo Ishibashi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT88vv28jdQ)

	 I knew not the Cantareel and now I am calmed. 


* [Impulse Purchase - OK Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwzbIUffcR4)

	 You can take OK Go out of art school, but you'll never take the art school out of OK Go. A great example of showing your homework!


* [If It Makes You Happy - Hamish Hawk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc-wu0ZUvQY)

	 Sweet Dreams is a solid cover too. I'd go to a Hamish Hawk covers only gig.


* [It's Raining Men (The Weather Girls Cover) - Playlunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDKaxKpdJF4)

	 There's nothing like committing 100% to something. This band delivers the best cover I've heard of It's Raining Men!


* [Song For The Dead - Queens Of The Stone Age with Mark Lanegan and Dave Grohl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOsmG-sufNc)

	 I've seen QOTSA and they weren't in their prime because neither Mark nor Dave were there... this on the other hand is prime. The [accompanying interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDHdiLiYp0U) isn't anyone's best work but it's a snapshot in time. And my word does Mark's stage presence dominate despite doing nothing and Dave's drumming is the best in the world.


* [The Typewriter by Leroy Anderson at the Last Night of the Proms 2025 - Bill Bailey and the BBC Symphony Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eda-anZvjZY)

	 I have no idea what format we listened to this on but this song was a core childhood memory of my dad, that and singing along to the bubblecar "Beep Beep" song with him. 


* [Defying Gravity - Josh Ramsay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePPpt8ef_Ww)

	 Josh is who you want to bring the energy and high notes! Wrote [Call Me Maybe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxamb-R9U5M) and thought he'd add a few higher notes in to Defying Gravity - genius.


* [When Everything Was New - Christian LÃ¶ffler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRBl_86x618)

	 Lovely. 


* [Walk Don't Run - The Surfaris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nnvh0mkniJ4)

	 Wednesday's second season sucked in my opinion - how on earth it managed better ratings than season one is beyond me. Whatever - episode 6 bodyswap was fun. And there wasn't as much great music but hitting the road north in a sidecar to The Surfaris was a nice touch.


* [The Chiptune Legacy - Big Giant Circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryhybXuK1r0)

	 Revisited an old album and was blown away by this track once again.


* [Something In The Water - Bad Knees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JukWThkHvCE)

	 90s sounding grunge from a new Edinburgh band. 


* [Katana Zero - LudoWic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfSwxETYAd8)

	 More streams than some of the new NIN tracks...


* [Junket - Comfort Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpgYK-34MFo)

	 This song's better than the new Biffy album.
