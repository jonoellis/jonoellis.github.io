<p>Suffice to say that I don't think you should bother listening to The Shaggs “Philosophy of the World” - it's terrible. There - that's the kind of review you don't often get on music blogs. It's not that it's lo-fi - it's just that it's amateur to the point of bad. I'm not sure what made Kurt Cobain like this at all!</p>
