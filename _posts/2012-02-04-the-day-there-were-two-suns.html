The Day There Were Two Suns - St. Giles, Edinburgh (1879)
Today I used a photo that I took of St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh and played around with the filters and effects to scale and crop the image, add the suns, make it sepia, add the border and finally top it off with a coffee stain. Time: 1 hour (+ the extra time the computer took when I tried to do the effects on a 8MB image!)
