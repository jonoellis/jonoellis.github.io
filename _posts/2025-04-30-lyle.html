<a href="https://ellis.scot/2024/06/glow/">You've met Glow! right?</a> Now it's time to meet Lyle!

<p>Meet Lyle! They like squealing feedback, licking batteries, taking tablets they find on nightclub floors,  drinks with a warning label about caffeine content, sticking nails in the tires of pavement parkers, sleeping naked and reading Jane Eyre.</p>
<p>Comrade <a href="https://ellis.scot/2024/06/glow/">Glow!</a> felt lonely so I thought I'd do a tiny evening project to build them a little glowing friend from a 2xAAA power pack, a GIANT LED (still very small), a clicky switch, a syrup tin, a second syrup tin lid and a weird squared-off bolt. Next iterations might include some glow in the dark paint and acrylic paint eyes. Always refreshing to do something with physical materials after so much computer time and interesting to play with hiding the switch.</p>
<p> Again, imperfect but complete.</p>
