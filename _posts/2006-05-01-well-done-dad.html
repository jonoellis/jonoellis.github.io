<p>Well done goes to Dad for managing to cycle the first 30 miles and then walking the next 43 miles from Fort William to Inverness in 21.5 hours! I'm pretty proud, a bit disappointed I wasn't able to be there (because of mumps) and most of all glad that you arrived safely at the end!Woo! The Matrix is on. Again. Although I have seen it many times it remains a classic and  there is nothing else on tv tonight (and I still have mumps so I am not going anywhere).</p>
<p>Since I am a wee bit bored I've created this little link to remind people (using their Google Calendar) that Saturday is ceilidh day for Clannen in Duns village hall. See you there.</p>
