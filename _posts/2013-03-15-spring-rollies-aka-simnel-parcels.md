<p>It&rsquo;s time for another ingredient swap courtesy of my amazing wife Ruth and her <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/spring-surprise.html">Makey-Cakey</a> blog. This time around my swap partner was Jean at <a href="http://bakinginfranglais.blogspot.co.uk/">Baking in Franglais</a> and she very kindly sent me raisins, marzipan and some dairy-free chocolate coated raisins - what a winning combo. I&rsquo;d have happily eaten the whole block of marzipan but that&rsquo;s not really the point of an ingredient swap! I haven&rsquo;t used the dairy-free chocolate raisins yet - there&rsquo;s a chance that my dairy-free daughter may well be given them to nom if I have a parenting emergency any time soon! Anyway - seeing as it&rsquo;s almost spring I thought I&rsquo;d attempt to make something Eastery with only four ingredients (as long as you don&rsquo;t count oil or mixed spice!). Here are the ingredients:</p>
<ul><li><span>Filo pastry </span></li>
<li><span>Marzipan</span></li>
<li><span>Apple </span></li>
<li><span>Raisins</span></li>
</ul><p><span>Here&rsquo;s what to do: Grease a tin and layer 3 strips of filo with oil between each layer. Next put one strip of marzipan down the middle of the pastry, then layer a handful of raisins and some lightly microwaved apple, stewed with a little water and mixed spice or cinnamon. Roll into parcels/sausages and cook for about 20 mins at 160C. </span></p>
<p>Thank you to Jean and Ruth. :)</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
