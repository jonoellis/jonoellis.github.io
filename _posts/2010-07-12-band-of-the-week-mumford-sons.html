<p>I know that I've used Mumford &#038; Sons before but their T in the Park performance of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/tinthepark/2010/artists/mumford_and_sons/">The Cave</a> is just too awesome to ignore. Similarly I've used Frightened Rabbit a ton of times before but how could I not mention <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/tinthepark/2010/artists/frightened_rabbit/">The Loneliness &#038; The Scream</a> (starts at 4:45). Stunning.</p>
