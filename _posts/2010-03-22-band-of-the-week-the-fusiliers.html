<p>Leith based "The Fusiliers" have a cool sound that initially made me think of "Tourists In The Warzone" (except with a more Edinburghy accent) and they're definitely worth a listen. "She Cries" is a brilliant track but if you only stay on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/wearethefusiliers">MySpace</a> for a couple of minutes you've got to check out "The Way" first. Browse their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/wearethefusiliers#!/wearethefusiliers?v=wall">Facebook</a> for more of the banter.</p>
