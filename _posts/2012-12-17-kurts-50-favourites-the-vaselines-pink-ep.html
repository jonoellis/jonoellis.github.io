<p>The Vaselines are another Scottish band! You might already know <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_for_It_(EP)">some of their work</a> because it was covered by Nirvana, although the originals are even more lo-fi. The "EP" (also called "Dying For It") makes up tracks 4 - 7 of the "Enter The Vaselines" album and there's some lovely tracks here. Definitely worth a listen and it's an album that's making me want to get sorted and record music, no matter how lo-fi it sounds.</p>
