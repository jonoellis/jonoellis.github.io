I made this to try out making inverted text - feel free to download as a desktop wallpaper if you want. Made using an awesome background <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/astroporn/4341633116/sizes/l/in/photostream/">Rosette Nebula, HaRGB</a> by Adam Evans (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/" rel="nofollow">Attribution-NonCommercial License</a>)
