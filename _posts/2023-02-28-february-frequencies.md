Here's what's filled my ears this month:


* 6955\
	 I am a massive fan of the (unused) [Fez EP by 6955](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tKHvijxS-I) which led me to Super Time Force OST and the amazing track [Heaven Candidate](https://6955.bandcamp.com/) - what a sound! 1m44 on Heaven Candidate truly is a candidate for heaven. 

* Choir! Choir! Choir!\
	 Especially [Colin Hay's Overkill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCZKAxDoUwE) and [Blur's Girls & Boys](https://boingboing.net/2023/02/21/choir-choir-choir-take-on-blurs-girls-boys.html). I'd love to sing along some time.
   
* [Sarah Barrios - Thank God You Introduced Me to Your Sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVck-gwJ7IU)\
	 Always a fan of some new pop-punk.
   
* Sigur Rós\
	 Despite having seen Sigur Rós in one of my all-time most memorable gigs, I'd never actually watched [Heima](https://youtu.be/XtmaZNhs2t8?t=4512) - the moment in the film that I've linked to is a proper shivers moment!

* [Bratakus](https://bratakus.bandcamp.com/album/ghoul-power)\
	 Some rural Scottish 2-peice Riot grrrl!

* [Stuzzi - satsuma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP2HLeEK378&list=WL&index=7)\
	 A jolly little ditty that I heard on Radio 2 one evening. It has a Vampire Weekend vibe to the production. 
   
* The Ballroom Thieves - Deadeye\
	 The track Bees blew me away!
   
* VUKOVI - HADES\
	 ALL-CAPS Scottish metal.
   
* [Kelsy Karter & The Heroines - Crying (Stripped)](https://open.spotify.com/track/3ZkUNNLDiTwTSeE5jFnfzq?si=8d790a8f23d949a9)\
	 You might know the song but not like this.
   
* Wavetable Edinburgh sets\
   Especially from [Andrew Ostler](https://andrew-ostler.bandcamp.com/) and [Simon Kirby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE4Q2FW3Nfo).
