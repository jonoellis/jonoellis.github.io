<ul><li>Preheat oven at 170 degrees </li>
<li>Line a mini cupcake tray with 9 cases (or fewer bigger cases!)</li>
<li>Whisk 1 egg and &frac12; cup of chocolate spread/Nutella together</li>
<li>Whisk in 5 tablespoons of SR flour</li>
<li>Add some chopped macadamia nuts</li>
<li>Pour into cupcake cases</li>
<li>Cook until a tester comes out with sticky crumbs on it (10 mins ish for mini cupcakes, 20 mins ish for muffin-esque cakes)</li>
</ul><p>There - 4 ingredients and 20 minutes and you&rsquo;ve got some of the most delicious cupcakes you&rsquo;ll ever taste. Downside is that the recipe doesn&rsquo;t make all that many!

<p>&ldquo;But whose birthday is it?&rdquo;, you ask! Well - my beautiful wife has a birthday coming up this weekend and it&rsquo;s for her. But being a magnificent baker, cook and blogger she is hosting an ingredient swap on her blog and is asking bloggers around the world to make a cake with the surprise ingredients in her honour. Check out her blog for more details: <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/makey-cakey-birthday-surprise.html" title="Makey Cakey ">Makey Cakey</a>.  </p>
<p>Many many many thanks to <a href="http://theteensytinyinsignificantdetails.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/scottish-tablet-cup-cakes-with-whisky.html">Vanessa</a> who was my ingredient swap buddy and who sent me an awesome parcel of Australian goodies (including the macadamia nuts). Vanessa made <a href="http://theteensytinyinsignificantdetails.blogspot.com.au/2012/07/scottish-tablet-cup-cakes-with-whisky.html">Scottish Tablet Cupcakes with Whisky Icing</a> with the ingredients that I sent her - check them out, they look amazing!!!!</p>
