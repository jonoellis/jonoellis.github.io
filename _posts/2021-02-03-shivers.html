<p>Bands will always have great performances but there's a special place in my heart for perfect live performances of amazing tunes which were captured on film. Here are a few songs with multiple versions, each one of which is totally killer, which have been stuck on repeat for me recently.</p>

<h2>San Fermin - Sonsick</h2>
<p>Rae Cassidy only had a brief period as vocalist for San Fermin but she absolutely owns this track, be it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K9gjhbT7xs">behind a tiny desk concert</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCEqNcMeW8g">in the studio</a> or even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzxNQyTxLYQ">walking about</a>! This is is my personal fave - the brass production is on point and the vocals are sublime:</p>

<p></p>

<h2>MEUTE - You & Me</h2>
<p>Not many bands perform remixes... but then not many marching bands are "techno" marching bands.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Frightened Rabbit - Poke</h2>
<p>Painful as it is I've had the Belle Angele and Queens Hall FR gigs in my head a lot lately - both were awe-inspiring but sadly one that seemingly wasn't captured at all and one that was captured terribly! Home crowds, sweaty and insanely loud. Sure there are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob3X77TwqEw">better recordings of Scott's performances</a>... but...</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Foo Fighters - Times Like These</h2>
<p>I have so much love for Dave and the gang. This song has been part of my life since it came out. The Foos were amazing when they played the (crappy but much missed) Meadowbank Stadium and they've been fab every time I've seen them. I'm still gutted that I didn't make the effort to get to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvCUXXsP5WE">Wembley</a> and as much as they sound unbelievable live there's something special about this recording.</p>

<h2>Nine Inch Nails - Hurt</h2>
<p>Whilst I'm actually much more in to the [heavier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOVW938sr0k) [stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA281OuU3rk) there's something so raw about this performance of Hurt... and my love of the Johnny Cash version and the story that goes with that is similarly emotive.</p>

<p></p>


<h2>Bon Iver - Heavenly Father</h2>
<p>And then there's Bon Iver. Justin Vernon, The Staves and Sydney Opera House. So much love for this. There's no denying that this is a song with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG8jY0EhfUE">multiple amazing versions</a>, including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5rKg_taM0">one-to-one that's full of passion and nervous energy</a>, but this one is my favourite:</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Taylor Swift & Bon Iver - exile</h2>
<p>And then there's this Bon Iver performance along with Taylor Swift. Creating, writing and performing during lockdown makes it all the more special.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Tim Minchin -  Hallelujah</h2>
<p>Karaoke in the Fringe in Teviot was a laugh on the few times I did it and there were often some amazing singers - like this little session:</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Hugh Jackman - From Now On</h2>
<p>The Greatest Showman soundtrack was played so often in our house that it seeped in to my subconscious - we even had a memorable car journey up from Norfolk where we sang the whole thing through twice to keep the back-seat passenger entertained. Although I knew Hugh Jackman could sing, and although the setting of this video is super cheesy, he shows why he was picked for the part and the surprise of him starting to sing clearly gives the whole room shivers.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Chvrches - The Mother We Share</h2>
<p>So much love for Chvrches. I've seen them a couple of times and they never fail to give amazing performances. I love this one as it's the first high-quality recording of this track and it shows 100% what the band were all about.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>OK Go - This Too Shall Pass</h2>
<p>No band does brain-bending videos in the way that OK Go do but something they do even better than that is their skill at doing seamless, one-takes. The high-register instruments at 2:30 sends shivers every single time!</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Eddie Vedder - Rise</h2>
<p>I love the album version but there's something so raw about Eddie performing this unaccompanied and passionately.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Twin Atlantic - Heart & Soul</h2>
<p>I love this track so much - the band were still to release the album The Great Divide when they performed this at Glastonbury 2014 but it already had a huge place in their audience's hearts.</p>

<p></p>


<h2>Sweet Sweet Moon - Psalm For The Elks Lodge Last Call (originally by The Weakerthans)</h2>
<p>This is one of those rabbit holes of obscure bands playing covers of songs I don't know... but since I first heard it in 2011 I've loved this version of this song. Playing violin and singing at the same time is a heroic skill always.</p>

<h2>Bleachers ft. Bruce Springsteen - chinatown</h2>
<p>I think Jack Antonoff is probably going to be remembered as one of the best song writers - his creative spark with other artists is just beautiful. </p>

<p></p>

<h2>Fear Factory - Final Exit</h2>
<p>Honestly did not expect this to ever be played live. &#60;Chef's kiss&#62;</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Phosphorescent - Song For Zula</h2>
<p>This performance is off the scale slick - the drummer looks like he's been replaced by a robot he's so tight. So much love for this band and they absolutely nail this performance.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Stars - One More Nighr</h2>
<p>This song is so angsty and this version is out of control with emotions that aren't in the recorded version - it seems like this song ends a big night for them.</p>

<p>There are of course others... and so I'll inevitably return to this to add a few more.</p>

<h2>Bonus one that I failed to capture</h2>
<h2>Hope & Social</h2>
<p>We had the immense pleasure of being inside the tent at Underneath The Stars when one of the biggest thunder storm downpours I've ever seen hit. Hope & Social had their set royally screwed over with stop-starts but they were finally allowed to return to the stage to conclude their set once the lightning passed and the possiblility of us all being frazzled had faded. I missed recording it as my phone didn't work, but thanks to the power of the internet a short clip exists:</p>
