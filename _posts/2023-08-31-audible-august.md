It's been a weird kind of month for music - a bit of holiday and a lot of work catching up calls meant far less new music than normal. But what I have been listening to has all been very enjoyable.


* [Stillness In Hand - Kalia Vandever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t7Rev1jj8g)

	 What a gorgeous album - a lovely chilled mix of trombone, effects and looping. Love it. 


* [i'm confident that i'm insecure - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ct65mJmHQnw)

	 The [new documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oueqa38OJ0) is a stunning work of editing. And new music? That would normally be the cherry on the cake... but this arrangement? That's the cherry cake on top of the cake!


* [Owl - The Cat Empire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5KTTJO-P4c)

	 A great fusion of styles as always. 


* [Fleeting Future - Akusmi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0S8Ip72zzk)

	 I could almost use the same description for Akusmi's music as I did for Kalia's but where Kalia sounded organic, Akusmi uses natural sounds but in a very precise way. Beautiful. 


* [Rich Men Earning North of a Million - Billy Bragg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGNFR7pgxDY)

	 Powerful lyrics. I saw Billy Bragg at Underneath The Stars a few years ago and he was an astounding performer. Legend. 


* [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMKXWVD698g)

	 I've not managed to watch the movie yet but the soundtrack is on point as everything from Trent and Atticus always is. Great to work to.  


* [Across The Spider-Verse - Daniel Pemberton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLjS8iateHE&list=PLDhajrZgo0TK7mphzI6bmyKWAfiP_xPAZ)

	 Another film I've not managed to get the time to watch, but the soundtrack is a full-on experience. 


* [Live At Radio City Music Hall - Bleachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq_eOM8h4TM)

	 One of those gigs that can only have happened at a specific place and time and, unlike many of those extra special moments, was captured in its fullness. Every single track sounds like they are in the encore and giving their final drops of energy!
