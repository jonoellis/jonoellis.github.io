Here's what's been stimulating my ear holes this month:

* [Handbook on How to Stay Alive - Look Mum No Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfITMAK4lnk)\
	 Sam is killing it with this the 90's Europop vibe on this. 

* [I'm Not Okay (I Promise) - First to Eleven (My Chemical Romance Cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n2deJ8d_9E)\
	 Always a fan of a cover and always a fan of this song - what's not to like?!

* [The Beths: Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt0J3IEYkIg)\
	 So nice that these folks got a Tiny Desk. Expert In A Dying Field is perfect. 

* [Talk - beabadoobee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zR_XDlBHEik)\
	 This song sounds so tight - and also sounds like it could have been on the Empire Records soundtrack. 

* [Emily I'm Sorry - Boygenius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0utmCIxfHgc)\
	 I realise at this point of my month's listening that I might be a teenage girl - the production on this track is on point.

* [Exhausting Lover - Ben Folds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6JA-4YgoCw)\
	 It's nice to have Ben back, especially with something that sounds like it's from a musical, has elements of Hamilton and has a very nifty sounding harmonium/organ thing at the start.

* [Blemishes - LIES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3szgLmEvWw)\
	 Is it weird that I like this because it has a [Jonnie Common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0EwFAx39zM) vibe?


* [Close Call - Brownbear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCYmZeXf5kU)\
	 Love a "do do dooo" chorus!

* [Timezone - Måneskin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlOZR5OwS-8)\
	 As with much of this (pretty awesome) album, the lyrics are provocative and the beat is catchy. [Read Your Diary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eGycga48ng) and [La Fine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2EMoyn83AM) are also highlights.

* [Big Train - Mike Watt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cfQaQO-YD4)\
	 I hadn't even heard that there was a band that had Eddie Vedder, Dave Grohl and Pat Smear in it until this month - how?!

* [Airborne Panic Attack - October Drift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ENPucWgvVU)\
	 Probably my album of the month - loving this sound!

* [Summers Magic - Mark Summers (from The World's End)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giwmGn-vnbQ)\
	 The World's End seriously stands a rewatch - loved it. 

* [Movement 6 - Erland Cooper, Scottish Ensemble, Simon Armitage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1FYuR14yqo)\
	 One of those songs that I heard on the radio and immediately rushed to listen through a few more times.
