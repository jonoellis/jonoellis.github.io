Here's what's been stimulating my ear holes this month:

* [The Twilight Sad - Keep Yourself Warm](https://thetwilightsad.bandcamp.com/track/keep-yourself-warm-live-2)\
	 The new band for Grant and the cover we didn't know we needed. This song gave me shivers. What a way to keep Scott's memory alive.
