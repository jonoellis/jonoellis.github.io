Holidays followed by the return to real life, the end of Buffy, International Festival and Ed Book Fest events, back to doing a lot of DIY, games nights, and life stresses. 


* [WW3 DRAFT MIX - Rock x House MOONLGHT Mix Vol. 1 - Moonlight](https://soundcloud.com/musicbymoonlght/ww3-draft-mix)

	 Bangin'


* [Promotion (Live from Sydney Opera House) - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5GANemi4yA)

	 I love this little series of videos outside (or on) iconic places. Thanks for keeping it going. And, again, well done to the producer for mixing the sound from the little iPhone mics into this. Also loving [musical showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUQHz9ue-lU).


* [THE INTOXICATION OF POWER - BRUIT â‰¤](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkhfY7nulAQ)

	 [The album](https://bruitofficial.bandcamp.com/album/the-age-of-ephemerality-2) is so intense. I've said it before but seeing this live would be life-changing. 


* [Pathos - Einaudi vs Einaudi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nrSWPY-Vuo)

	 Dancy. Leo's take on his dad's work. Looking forward to the album. 


* [Run Free - Soulwax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmBg0P079-U)

	 Can't wait for the album. The glitchy synth sounds very Chemical Brothers and I'm here for it. Note that [As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt. 2.]() is my favourite mix album and was the definitive listening for several years of my life. The [hidden zero track](https://www.2manybootlegs.com/bootleg-albums/as-heard-on-radio-soulwax/part-2/) required much holding of the rewind button on the Pret Castle Street CD player to get to [Kylie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN3P7QfNaxk). 


* [Pickle Rick - Ekoh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBk62c3Dy2k)

	 Flow!


* [Nude - Radiohead](https://archive.org/details/radiohead-work-in-progress-2000)

	 I've [was a huge Radiohead fan](https://ellis.scot/2022/05/17-albums/) as a teenager. As someone who also tried to play and write music I obsessed over [this bootleg](https://archive.org/details/radiohead-work-in-progress-2000). Works in progress are sometimes better than final versions. It was probably my most important posession for a brief while. Fun to re-listen. [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/radiohead-lost-treasures-1993-1997/CD+02+-+Track+02+-+Radiohead+-+Killer+Cars+(Acoustic+Version).flac) is a goldmine. I also found this gem of a bootleg with a final [Nobody Does It Better](https://archive.org/details/radiohead-never-a-dull-moment/17+-+Nobody+Does+It+Better.flac) cover - it's always weird to think back and see how well Radiohead had nailed the acoustic/semi-acoustic deep cuts with songs like Killer Cars, Thinking Of You, You Never Wash Up After Yourself, True Love Waits, Karma Police, Creep acoustic, etc then moved on entirely. Noting that the [rock out version of Killer Cars](https://archive.org/details/radiohead-the-b-sides-file/CD1+-+10+-+Killer+Cars.flac) is off the charts (track 10). I stand by my teenage self and their love of this iteration of [Manowar/Big Boots](https://archive.org/details/radiohead-work-in-progress-2000/12+-+Manowar-Big+Boots.flac) is the best, and the arpeggiator over [True Love Waits](https://archive.org/details/radiohead-work-in-progress-2000/09+-+True+Love+Waits.flac) is how it should always be. 


* [How to Talkbox - Lorenz Rhode
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_L5v9OTSxc)

	 I must admit I'd never thought about this... and I was in the misunderstanding category because of that!


* [American English - Idlewild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvl89VPWQ6g)

	 Classic. 


* [Take On Me - LEPROUS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te2MR6j5Qhg)

	 I'm such a fan of genre-crossing covers and behind the scenes... these guys kill it.


* [Malibongwe - Abel Selaocoe & Aurora Orchestra](www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSs6z_kwwGI)

	 Fascinating and stunning concert to witness at the Usher Hall. Many thanks to the Young Musician Programme!


* [In Seven - Peter Sandberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wpxj3j47z0)

	 A song that's embodies wonder.


* [porcelain - former champ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N4WE5p-D2U)

	 [Album coming soon](https://formerchamp.bandcamp.com/album/i-saw-you-in-paradise) - which is exciting. 


* [Michelle - Sir Chloe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqEo-DYh5CQ)

	 Melancholy and beautiful. Official video is heavy as.


* [Sleep In The Heat - PUP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQSxGcIg3g0)

	 Cathartic. [Obligatory TinyDesk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh9pCl1cL8A). Thinking the [props of this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyQJtQ0krFA) would be great for a stage show too. 


* [Procession - Jeff Russo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeHjm5cvUHM)

	 From Alien Earth. Fantastic, almost throwaway guitar solo that wouldn't sound out of place from Richie Sambora with effects over the top that sound like they're straight out of Radiohead's lab. Still not sure about Alien Earth though. 


* [Childhood Dream - Wojciech Golczewski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw__XBK26EM)

	 Found by an algo, seems apt.
