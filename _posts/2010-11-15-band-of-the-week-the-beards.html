<p>In honour of my winter beard this week's Band Of The Week are <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thebeardsclub">The Beards</a>. Hailing from Australia they do comedy songs mostly about beards. I was going to pick "It Only Takes A Fortnight..." but I thought that "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmFnarFSj_U&#038;feature=player_embedded">If Your Dad Doesn't Have a Beard, You've Got Two Mums</a>" had too ridiculous a title to ignore. Enjoy!<br />
