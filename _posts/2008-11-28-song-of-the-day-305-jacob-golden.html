<p>I seem to be loving a lot of music by singer/songwriters at the moment partly because I've been paying attention to <a href="http://daytrotter.com/">Daytrotter</a> a lot more of late. <a href="http://www.myspace.com/themusicofjacobgolden">Jacob Golden</a>'s album "Revenge Songs" is fantastic. And it's less than Â£5 at the moment on iTunes, which is pretty nice. The Daytrotter Session is here and is well worth a listen.</p>
