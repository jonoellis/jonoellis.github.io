<p>Dan Mangan has a nice folky sound and "<a href="http://www.myspace.com/danmangan">Robots</a>" is the only song that you need to listen to today. I promise you you'll be walking round singing the refrain for the rest of the day! All together now... "Robots need love too, they want to be loved by you".</p>
<p>Happy Monday everyone!</p>
