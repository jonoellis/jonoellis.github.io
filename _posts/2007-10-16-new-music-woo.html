<p>I love finding new music - here are three bands that I have only just found out about but really want to share:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/themaeshi">The Mae Shi</a> - I love Lamb and Lion</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/frightenedrabbit">Frightened Rabbit</a> - check out Be Less Rude</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/zoeyvangoey">Zoey Van Goey</a> - I love all 3 tracks!</li>
<p><font color="#dc143c">UPDATE:</font></p>
<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthZgszykLs">Still Alive</a> by Jonathan Coulton (from Portal)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.myspace.com/augiemarch">Augie March</a> (One crowded hour has had a massive number of listens - 161,101 people probably aren't wrong!)</li>
</ul>
