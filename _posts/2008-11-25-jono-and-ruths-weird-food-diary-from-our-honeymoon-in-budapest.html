<p>We ate some weird foods in Budapest. Not really way out weird, but just a bit different. Here's my list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sour raspberry and yoghurt flavour Knorr cuppa soup - tastes like raspberry juice but weirder. I can't understand why you'd drink it as soup. Yuk.</li>
<li>Fruit corner with yoghurt one one side and strawberry mixed with dessicated coconut on the other - definitely a good combination.</li>
<li>Cottage cheese corner with cherry compote - tasty because it's not as sweet as yoghurt. I can't see why this wouldn't catch on over here. </li>
<li>Soft white cheese in a finger stick coated in chocolate with strawberry or apricot down the middle - lovely smooth texture and really tasty.</li>
<li>Blackberry, blackcurrant, blueberry and banana Solero - I'm sure this one will be in the UK next year.</li>
<li>Tiramisu chocolate Milka roll - tasty good.</li>
<li>Cherry and grape juice - hmmm mmmm. </li>
<li>White cheese and sesame pasty thing from the equivalent of Greggs - worth trying to make at home. </li>
<li>Pear and carmel yogurt/Apple, cinnamon and cookie yogurt - not too sweet but very yummy. </li>
<li>Chocolate ball with <del>petrol</del> liquor centre - tasty but weirdly like petrol. </li>
<li>Wafers with butter cream and smokey coffee flavours - very sweet. Nice though.  </li>
</ul>
