A music festival, the Fringe, some very long hours of work and some great tunes... all bookended by feeling crap at the beginning and end of the month.  


* [Can't Help Falling In Love (Elvis Presley cover) - Lawrence](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3VraLRr_W6/)

	 It's testament to a band's talent that they could put a grainy snippet of a song on Instagram and it would still be one of the best things that I've heard this month.


* [Whatcha Want (acoustic-ish) - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwozDusaQxs)

	 Wow! The camera work synched with the audio mixing is so good. I'd listen to a whole album of these acoustic-ish one-take performances on repeat. 


* [Whatcha Want (live) - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rj9v22nNT8)

	 Yup - everything they drop is amazing. Compare this first performance with [their latest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS31mkyeYiQ)...


* [RITUAL (album) - Jon Hopkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3E_hG5c5QI)

	 It's upsetting that this album has only had a few hundred listens in the first 24 hours - it is a gorgeous soundscape and one of the artist's best things to yet.


* [can u see me in the dark?  - Halestorm & I Prevail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSDR_dZfbcg)

	 Combining two bands with massive sounds... to make a massive sound! 


* [WILDFLOWER - Billie Eilish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAWDqdpOlu8)

	 The vocal breakdown at the end is sumptuous!


* [Sigur Rós: Fljótavík - 12 Ensemble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2o4tm6E0U4)

	 I may have shared this before but it's worthy of a reshare any day of the year - the sound of Sigur Rós is always enhanced by a barrage of strings. 


* [Rats - Sloan Peterson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GydxpxuRqw4)

	 Found this lurking in my Shazam library - murky guitars and a retro vibe. 


* [Show You Mine - Alana Wilkinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mhmKKwgv5w)

	 So YouTube threw up [With A Boob Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngj7EeaE61A) but watching through a bunch of the videos they are so nice, so well filmed, the music so sentimental and funny. Show You Mine is a spot on, capture the moment recording. The [cover of Rusted Root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Deqv6kfQ7p0) is the best I've heard. And it would have been cool to be in [Redwood Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLS4VaK1ljM). 


* [Nautilus - Anna Meredith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unx1eXLSORg)

	 [Tiny Desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36FNJiP8GWk) is stunning and Nautilus is a work of art. 


* [Perfume - Zoë Fox and the Rocket Clocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJVm3_J38e4)

	 What a cool retro space vibe! (And the alien on [Flirting With Aliens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeOpP9DkIjk) is a wonderful thing too!)


* [Slow Mover - Angie McMahon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chhXp3kzc5s)

	 The chord pattern and tone through the chorus are very catchy, and the vocals have a late night feel to them even without watching the video. Just Like North has a similar vibe. 


* [Cruel Summer (Taylor Swift cover) - G Flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIz-Ji8Wyog)

	 Kicking ass on the drums AND the lead vocals!


* [Ode To Clio - Man/Woman/Chainsaw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaDt-_9xHKI)

	 Not fully understanding the lyrics but really liking the sound. 


* [The Only One - Ariela Jacobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85fHKmDc-Ek)

	 Some more Aussie indie-folk - always a fan of busking videos like this. 


* [Can't Stop - The Red Hot Chili Peppers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KgKoyaDgN4)

	 Always loving hearing this song, but how LA is this version?!


* [Baby's On The Border - Night Caller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqe9dldl9s4)

	 Love this from local Leithers. Number One Wee Guy has such a retro vibe and Begging for a Heart to Break has a great chorus - every song on this EP is a hit. 


* [Great Divide - Fanny Lumsden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISMLkHrHCWo)

	 Loved this live. Hey Dawn is a brilliant album. 


* [Out of My Head - First Aid Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDx2AfAbHgQ)

	 The driving beat of this song is so reminiscent of Fleetwood Mac and it's still great. 


* [Song & Dance Man - Mickey 9's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyxDcMEjidk)

	 Spoken word bit near the end is very amusing - I do love a bit of beat poetry.


* [So It Is - Rosie H Sullivan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCYj836MQNk)

	 The cover of Build Me Up Buttercup popped up in a playlist and took me down a path listening to the modern Hebridean sound. 


* [Hot Knife (Fiona Apple cover) - Mountain Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXtNsHX1Bno)

	 A band defined by their close harmonies. I love Rang Tang Ring Toon a lot too. I've sung in choirs and never achieved even 1% of this level of harmony and precision. 


* [Pett Level - Keston Cobblers Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBdu-daal7Q)

	 The euphonium! :)


* [Unbelievable - Citizen Papes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIuGqeikNIk)

	 Very jolly sound from this artist. [What Happens Next?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpneCQOI7uo) especially. 


* [Cloud Inversions - Look Mum No Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7TDCu3Yxzc)

	 Genuine mad scientist shit. Sam is a genius.


* [Fall At Your Feet (Crowded House cover) - Peking Duk and Julia Stone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIchYs0RaYM)

	 This version is so fresh and yet also so honest to the original - what a wonderful thing. 


* [The District Sleeps Alone Tonight (Remix) - Postal Service/Sylvan Esso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHzKQl1AU_E)

	 Fascinating remix from a band I'd not normally associate with the world of remixing.
