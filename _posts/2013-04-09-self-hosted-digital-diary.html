<p>Paper diaries seem a bit dated for the 21st century, where all text needs to be searchable. Carrying around traditional diaries also seems a little unwieldy when everywhere we go we have an internet-capable device. So here's an alternative - a self-hosted digital diary.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Use Google Drive and set up a form with a few fields that you want to record each day (I suggest fields to record where you are, what you did, how you felt, etc - I also included a few checkboxes for basic health tracking but you can record whatever you want from long-form text to ten bullet points)</span></li>
<li>Set the form to publish to a Goolge spreadsheet</li>
<li>Go to the live form and copy the code</li>
<li>Edit the page style and save it (you might want to prettify it a bit to strip out Google branding etc)</li>
<li>Upload the form as a page on your website/sub-domain using ftp</li>
<li>Visit that page each day and you've got a form that you can go to that will save your diary online for you</li>
</ol>
<p>I've been using this for a week and it's awesome. Let me know what you think!</p>
