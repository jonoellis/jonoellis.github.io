<p>This punk album from '79 is surprisingly listenable. At first I thought it sounded a little flat but when I read about it and realised that it was a fair bit older than me and that this is one of those bands/albums that influenced lots of other UK political punk bands then it really is pretty impressive. Given that it's pre-80s some of the tunes are actually surprisingly 2000s - "Not Great Men" could be Franz Ferdinand, Damaged Goods could be The Automatic. Definitely worth a listen. :)<br />
