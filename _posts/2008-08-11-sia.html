Sia - Breath Me<br />
After a 3 week break SOTD is back. I thought I'd start the week with a chilled out track since I've been at work since 8 and am still feeling a bit sleepy. Last week I trawled through some RSS feeds in Google Reader and I've started adding some interesting ones to my <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/shared/05195731409910396142">shared items page</a>. Check out my comments in blue. I think that I might try to add this directly into Wordpress as a way of blogging about other people's stuff more easily but for the moment you'll just need to check it out as a page. Enjoy.</p>
