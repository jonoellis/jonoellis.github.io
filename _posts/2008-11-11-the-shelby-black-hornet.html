<p>Carroll Shelby has turned a stock 1968 Mustang into the Shelby Black Hornet and is auctioning it off to benefit the Carroll Shelby Children's Foundation. Bidding starts on <a href="http://cgi3.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewUserPage&#038;userid=carroll_shelby_childrens_foundation_auction">eBay</a> at $100,000. Anyone looking for Christmas presents for me should take note!<br />
