![A wooden robin sculpture](https://ellis.scot/uploads/2026/bobbin.jpg)

Meet Bobbin', a wooden robin made from some woodscraps as a gift. The spring is from my Papa's toolbox of random bits and bobs, the base wood came from Bowhill Estate from when mum worked there about 20 years ago, the body is an offcut from the desk I built in our spare room and the tail is from a carrycase of some fancy oil and vinegar bottles we were given for Christmas a few years back.
