Such a busy month and since I'm trying to get through Jerusalem I've been listening to way less music and way more audiobook. I should be done by Feb at the current rate!


* [A Summer Thing - Cayucas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Z7r-DimaU)

	 Sweet, Beach-Boys-y vibes. Totally out of season but the song of the month. 


* [For Forever - Alas de Liona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_TvI65_YMc)

	 This video is a hoot and this song is so epic it's not just for Halloween. (Loving the Edinburgh shots)


* [How To Hide A Body - Daisy Grenade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxP5REjw5Jc)

	 This song would have killed it back in the late 90s (and it's pretty awesome right now).


* [Stand By Me - Stephen Wilson Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kn7E-OauJI)

	 A song that my high-school friends loved to randomly mix in with Black Sabbath, The Offspring and Blink-182 done in a way that sends shivers. 


* [Live at the Bowery Ballroom - Bleachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WjFuWhW8ck)

	 Since I don't have (and don't want) Amazon Music in my life, it might be a while before I hear the album but this recording captures the vibe of the Glasgow gig and has some nice insight into the songwriting process. (PS. Amazon shoving 18 rated trailers INTO THE MIDDLE OF A PG MOVIE can get to hell too).


* [Youth8500 - Look Mum No Computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-kpzAH-n-A)

	 Boppy, bleepy and anthemic. 


* [I Want It All - Katie Gavin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzVifea9gLc)

	 An album of soft country tones and powerful lyrics. 


* [The Prawn Song - Superorganism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K49QKVR0p0)

	 Sound effect recording capture is so good you'd think they were samples. And a group of peeps that look like they are living their best lives.
