<p>I've been working on a tabletop game idea - I just wanted to share where I'm up to so far.</p>
<h2>Rules/setup:</h2>
<p>Two players each with a tray of 6 characters (either from the world of Scooby-Doo or the world of Harry Potter). A third player is an adjudicator (Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot) <br />Players set their characters in the order that they wish to play (left to right) and face their opponent (random pairings). <br />The scorer picks which side will start (then turn about) - they then play through 6 rounds of duels. <br />For each duel the scorer sets the room then players describe what they would do with their character in that situation (attack then defence). When scored the losing character sits down, winner stays standing. Most standing at the end wins.</p>
<h2>Equipment:</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 black Lego boards 6x42</li>
<li>2 Lego team icons (Lego Dimensions Mystery Machine 71206</li>

<h2>Story introduction:</h2>
<p>Welcome to 12 Grimmauld Place, the historic residence of the famous wizarding family Black, current residence of Harry Potter, and headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix.<br />This morning started out a typical day in the wizarding home - Kreature made breakfast, Ginny was beating Ron at wizard chess, Hermione and Hagrid were debating appropriate used of spider venom, Harry and Luna reading copies of the Quibbler sent by Luna's dad.<br />Suddenly a knock at the door catches all of their attention.<br />Outside, stand six friends who call themselves Mystery Inc. They are obsessed with finding proof of magic. They have followed years of clues and leads to get to this point - they are absolutely certain that this very house, number 12 Grimmauld Place, contains actual wizards and witches.<br />They knock again. The door magically swings open.<br />The wizards peer out at them from behind a one-way mirror. Hermione recognises them immediately. Dumbledore's Army listens in, hearing the awe at the house, the range of emotions from curiosity to abject terror and the age-old phrase "Let's split up, it'll make the searching faster".<br />Hermione whispers to the others "This is a big deal. They are the good guys and they are good people, but they could expose the whole wizarding world and show muggles that magic really exists. We have to stop them getting out of here and revealing the truth. We can't hurt them though, stuns and scaring only! "<br />The two super smart teams of friends sneak their way around the 5 storey mansion.<br />In front of you, you will find your characters. Whether you are investigating or spellcasting you may come up with your own moves.</p>
<h2><br />Story outro - Dumbledore's Army wins:</h2>
<p>The six duels over, the Wizards have succeeded in keeping magic safe from the muggle world for another day. Hermione changes the memories of their guests and sends them into the street, happily eating a Berty Bot Every Flavour Bean each, thinking they had asked directions to the closest fun fair. As the door closes Ron gives a call of "Scooby Doobie Doo!"</p>
<h2>Story outro - draw:</h2>
<p>The six duels over the two gangs have been remarkably well matched. Kreacher saves the day by rounding up the exhausted wizards and detectives and takes them all to the kitchen. Making the Mystery Inc. all promise to keep the existence of magic a secret with an unbreakable vow, he then serves up a round of Butterbeer and pumpkin pasties. The food and drinks thaw attitudes. A massive belch from Scooby is followed by a larger, possibly magically enhanced one, from Luna. Soon the group are all laughing and sharing stories into the night.</p>
<h2><br />Story outro - Mystery Inc. wins:</h2>
<p>The duels over, Mystery Inc. have succeeded in avoiding spells, curses and hexes (and a rather pesky house ghost) to gain real knowledge of the existence of magic. Velma realised the enormity of their discovery and sits her group down. They agree not to share their newfound secrets and offer to take any of Dumbledore's Army with them on their next investigation. Luna makes Shaggy and Scooby a giant magical sandwich as a thank you.</p>
