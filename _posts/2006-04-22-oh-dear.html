<p>...I've got <a title="Mumps" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps">mumps</a>. This sucks. Lots. I look like a <a title="hamster" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster">hamster</a>. I hope that I don't get any more <a title="symptoms" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps#Symptoms">symptoms</a> other than a very sore neck. Worst of all is the fact that I am probably going to miss Dad's big adventure: the Maggie's monster bike and hike 2006 (unless I can go alone with my tent and not breathe near anyone!) The big event is next weekend and I know that he is going to do just fine. Good luck to him and the rest of "Oliver's plodder's". In other news... it doesn't look very likely that I am going to be becoming a primary school teacher any time soon (thanks to not getting a place at Aberdeen and everywhere else being full). Oh well, life goes on and life will be different and most likely better because of it.</p>
