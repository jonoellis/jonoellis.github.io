<p>These three links have nothing to do with one another but if you aren't working you might want to check out this <a href="http://alverson.wordpress.com/2006/12/11/huashan-video/">extreme plank walking video</a>. If you are still thinking about work then the <a href="http://www.welie.com/patterns/index.php">Interaction Design Pattern Library</a> is a great resource which gives the reasons why you should be providing users with certain interface elements on your website. Lastly... someone has posted a video of the aforementioned <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhj5CVBNnSc">Lego AT AT walker</a>. Yey.</p>
