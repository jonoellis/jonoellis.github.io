<p>This is a Christmas follow-up to <a href="http://ellis.scot/2017/06/interactive-story/">my first interactive story experiment</a> where I wanted to experiment with readers being able to adapt and interact with stories as they read. Give it a go below - all you need to do is click on a word/phrase to replace it. </p>
