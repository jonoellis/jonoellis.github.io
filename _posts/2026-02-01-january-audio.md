Great disappointment that the neighbours got approval for a front-of-our-house sunlight-blocking extension (at this point I could talk for days on the intersection of capitalist society, the wrongness of being able to use money to buy the community's access to sunlight, and a planning process with no route for appeals)... that said, a great month for news about a friend's health, lots of wonderful socialising including our first family jamming session, snow!, lots of ai and data analytics training/learning, trying hard to keep on getting decent 5k fit, and a family birthday afternoon tea. So much to love.


* [Cenotaph - Ghost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVOLAC23BC4)

	 Already mentioned in my end of year writeup for 2025 but really I've only given this album justice this January. Amazing.


* [New York, New York - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WoCqEZMBL0)

	 Oh to have this much talent and to be having that much fun on stage. 


* [Giant - Abnorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov0cM_lGYkg)

	 Scottish, female-led rock - always here for it.


* [Torn - Ednaswap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OoEdfB7l18)

	 The guitars are way heavier than the best-known version (and even this is a cover of another version!)


* [Through The Trees - Low Shoulder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=851ksBW0ZD0)

	 This song hit hard back when [Jennifer's Body](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3DqfXq690I) came out. Very Fall Out Boy.


* [Pink Pony Club (Chappell Roan cover) - GWAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5XR48KLE8I)

	 Here for this kind of chaos/talent. 


* [Float - Alma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xTRft6y4tg)

	 Folksy in a way that sounds Scottish, Appalachian and Southern at the same time.


* [Ramblin' Down The Road - Sadie Sink](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYm9LUQMkII)

	 See also my old blog post list of [actors who can sing](https://ellis.scot/category/actors-who-can-sing/)


* [Closer (NIN cover) - Allie Goertz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rj25Wya51K8)

	 Hits hard for something so gentle. Great work from the video production team too.


* [The Man Comes Around - Pulp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfXo2yhqjYs)

	 Classic song... another future standard?


* [Cursive (feat. Manchester Orchestra) - Matt Maeson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19XG4s5tiA0)

	 A heavy song with some great instrumentation


* [Cobra - Geese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnlV03_iFcI)

	 Van Morrison, is that you?


* [Constellations - Suzzallo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MiGcxLGreA)

	 Constellations, The Destroyer, River - all amazing tracks. The songwriting emotional rawness of Frightened Rabbit with the sounds of the Stereophonics, Radiohead and a little Blink. 


* [The Doll People - Sofia Isella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD-uRFa2qkE)

	 Weird and weirdly captivating. 


* [Screwball Scramble - Dictator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_G0URBsBWc)

	 Locals. Sounds like it could come from a late 90s teen movie.
