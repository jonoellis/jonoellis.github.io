<div><a href="https://mastodon.scot/@jonoellis/114555562589179611">Unfortunately beloved Glitch.com is closing down so I'm rescuing little code projects of old</a>. A while back a few friends were watching through Buffy the Vampire Slayer and before I joined the party I wanted to check how long it was going to take to watch through all episodes so I made this wee calculator/silly little tool. Good show - has aged well. Can recommend <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/the-rewatcher-buffy/">The Rewatcher</a> as a guide.</div>

        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 20px; }

        input { width: 100%; padding: 5px; }

        const percentageComplete = (watchedMinutes / totalMinutes * 100).toFixed(2);
