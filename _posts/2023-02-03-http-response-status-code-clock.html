Sometimes I get mad ideas and my coding just isn't up to scratch to bring the idea to fruition. Today I thought "I wonder if it's possible to have a little clock that tells the time, but whenever the time gets to a time that matches an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">HTTP status code</a> it would print it out. I was thinking something like 4:04 Time not found! GTP and I had a wee chat and, after a few rounds of revisions, here is the code. Clearly the code isn't mine (although I did a fair bit of response code wrangling in Google Sheets, a fair bit of console debugging and had to actually understand what the code was doing when ChatGPT went mad and started ignoring what I asked it), hopefully at least the original idea was mine!

    <div id="clock"></div>
    <div id="messages"></div>

<script>
  let messages = [
