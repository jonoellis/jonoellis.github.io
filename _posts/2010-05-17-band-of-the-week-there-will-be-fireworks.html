<p>Happy Monday everyone! Once again it's time for this week's Band Of The Week! I've been meaning to use <a href="http://www.myspace.com/therewillbefireworks">There Will Be Fireworks</a> for a few weeks and I'm glad to present you with We Are A Roman Candle; it's an awesome tune from a great sounding band. Enjoy.<br />
