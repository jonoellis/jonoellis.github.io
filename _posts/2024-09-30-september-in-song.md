There's not so much been a dearth of new music and more an insanely long audiobook on the speakers and earphones this month (Jerusalem - Alan Moore - insane creativity). Still, some great tunes. 


* [Help Is On The Way - Lake Street Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yrjl-9RPxo)

	 "Bigger dreams, smaller ego
Less machines, more libido" and 
"Longer life, lower tension
Endless knowledge, no retention
I forget now, did I mention
I'm tryna help myself?" 
are genius lyrics. And to have Lawrence on a live take is pretty awesome too. 


* [House Of The Rising Sun - Harvard Veritones A Cappella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn9qmNmTW6s)

	 Oooh the bass! And then literal shivers from their [Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQoEeGAbZ0U) cover. This show must have been stunning. (I've [mentioned Harvard Veritones](https://ellis.scot/2007/11/a-list-of-cool-acapella-tunes/) before - they've been smashing it and evolving for a long time, and I've been listening for at least 17 years). I'd pay to watch a multi-camera, proper sound deck recording of a full show. 


* [Stars Turn Cold - The Bygones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjS8R9Oi9IU)

	 A song that would be ideal for a montage scene in a teen indie movie. And such a dirty sax solo!


* [Promises - Alas De Liona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc5krZbeNoU)

	 This track drew me in more than anything else on the album initially, then Driftwood and Summer Rain. Lovely stuff. 


* [Film Buff - Sl√∏tface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RstQ1itoZZE)

	 If you've read anything here then you'll know I'm weird. Weird enough to enjoy listening to radio from [Radio Garden](https://radio.garden/listen/radiorevolt/7vtU9axh) in languages that I don't speak whilst I work. (Use Opera with VPN on if you're in the UK. ü§¨ Brexit.) This week's been all about [Radio Revolt](https://radiorevolt.no/) from Trondheim, Norway and has brought me Sl√∏tface and Rektor. And Sl√∏tface' new album Film Buff is fantastic. 


* [Stolheisen (feat. Kaja Gunnufsen)
 - Rektor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUgWrnRh1hU)

	 DIY mountain-emo punk band from Norway.
