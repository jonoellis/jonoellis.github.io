<p>I'm normally game for a challenge but I have to say that this one made me feel a little queazy! For the April Daring Cooks Challenge, Lisa from <a href="http://parsleysagesweet.com/">Parsley, Sage and Sweet</a> has challenged us to debone a whole chicken, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAekQ5fzfGM"> using this video by Jacques Pepin as our guide</a>; then stuff it, tie it and roast it, to create a Chicken Ballotine.</p>
<p>And I wanted to try all of that using only 4 ingredients!! Ingredient 1 - the chicken&hellip; leaving 3 ingredients for the stuffing. </p>
<p>The process in the video wasn&rsquo;t too hard to follow (although I think I got the front and back a bit mixed up at one point!) but I have to say that it took me a while to get it right. The wing bones were fairly easy to sort out but I struggled a bit with the fillets - possibly because they were quite small, maybe because I am so strong I ripped them off too early!! Once I was done I seasoned with salt, pepper and a little paprika and chilli. </p>
<p>For the stuffing I used:</p>
<ul><li>My wife&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s bread</li>
<li>Mushrooms</li>
<li>Yellow pepper</li>
</ul><p>I finely chopped the mushrooms and pepper and softened them in the microwave then breadcrumbed the bread (although my wife pointed out that I should have removed the crusts!). I mixed the stuffing together and layered out on top of the chicken. The wrapping and tying were easier than the deboning! Cooked and cooled it&rsquo;s even able to be sliced for sandwiches! :) A great challenge and thanks to my wife&rsquo;s assistance with working out which part of a chicken was which - as well as awesome knowledge of chicken anatomy <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/daring-cooks-april-2013-challenge-make.html">her ballotine</a> was tastier than mine too!</p>
<p>Thank you for a great challenge - definitely would do this again.</p>
