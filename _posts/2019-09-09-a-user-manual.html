<p>Here's a user manual of me - based off the many versions that are out there but especially the one shared by <a href="https://medium.com/@cassierobinson/a-user-manual-for-me-d3a851fbc694">Cassie Robinson</a>. I've got no expectations from this, I just thought that it was a nice exercise to do.</p>
<p>Conditions I like to work in</p>

<ul>
<li>I like a quiet environment and prefer interruptions to come in a batch. Open plan offices make concentration hard! </li>

<li>I've pretty much always got headphones to tune out the background noise.  </li>

<li>I like having my own desk space, mostly so that I can connect laptops to bigger screens.  </li>

<li>Fresh air is always appreciated.  </li>

<li>Perfume, flowers (especially lilies) and other strong smells make for migraines! </li>

<li>Desks with enough leg room underneath are essential. </li>
</ul>

<p>The times/Hours I like to work</p>

<ul>
<li>Family is really important to me so to fit in childcare I'm mostly a 9-5 in the office kind of guy but I'll take something home if needed.  Pandemic times haven't changed my working hours all that much, starting a little earlier and finishing later if I'm honest!</li>

<li>I'm generally a morning person.  </li>

<li>I write best when the house is silent and everyone else is asleep - midnight to 2am, or 5am to 7am are great but I don't do this especially often.   </li>

<li>I don’t mind being contacted about work at any time but I will likely only respond to non-emergencies during week daytimes.  </li>

<li>My work calendar is open so anyone can see my availability - I don’t mind people booking things in my diary if I am free (please leave gaps for travel!) </li>

<li>I don't mind meeting over lunch.  </li>
</ul>

<p>The best ways to communicate with me</p>

<ul>
<li>WhatsApp or Slack are good, in person is better.  </li>

<li>I rarely hear my phone ring but check it frequently. </li>

<li>I keep on top of my emails and usually respond on the day or within a few days at the latest. </li>

<li>I'm totally cool with finding out about work tasks through Trello/Jira - I'll come chat if I need more info. </li>
</ul>

<p>The ways I like to receive feedback</p>

<ul>
<li>Face-to-face by preference but feedback is always appreciated in any form.  </li>

<li>I love hearing feedback close to the event so that it's fresh.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Things I need</p>

<ul>
<li>Air. Water. Tea (mostly decaff, has to be hot hot and not cool/cold). Food. Conversation. Creativity. Plants are okay too.</li>

<li>Time: analysis work often isn't quick to do.  </li>

<li>A clear vision to work to. </li>
  
  <li>A to do list: if it isn't on the list then it won't be done!</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I struggle with </p>

<ul>
<li>Office politics.  </li>

<li>Meetings with no direction/goal.  </li>

<li>Having to use multiple devices to get one job done.  </li>

<li>Daddy longlegs(crane fly) and moths</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I love</p>

<ul>
<li>A long-term and multiplayer approach to work. </li>

<li>Equality and fairness.  </li>
  
<li>A good office culture and chances for serendipity, especially through hearing all of the cool things that my colleagues are up to (in and out of work).  </li>

<li>Recommendations of music, cafes/bars/restaurants, films, podcasts, shows, books and travel destinations (probably in that order!).</li>

<li>Socialising with colleagues.  </li>

<li>A sense of place.  </li>

<li>Writing, especially interactive fiction and near-future sci-fi. Creativity in general, writing most of all.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other things to know about me</p>

<ul>
  
<li>Pronouns: he/him/his or they/them/theirs</li>

<li>I try to cycle to meetings, which thankfully means I'm often faster than public transport. </li>

<li>I'm pretty much me wherever you see me. </li>

<li>I love to travel both small/local and big/adventurous. Cities looking for stickers or by a fire cooking outside under the stars. I try to travel as efficiently as I can, and am trying hard to travel as sustainably as I can. I really love the sleeper train to London and happily use video conferencing when it's available.  </li>

<li>I also try to live sustainably as well as trying to <a href="https://ellis.scot/2019/12/pledge/">shop locally</a>, I eat mueseli and make bread, buying in 25kg bags. 

<li>I'm trying to move away from paper notes so don't be offended if I'm typing notes during a meeting... but I also sometimes have to work during some meetings which I know is rude but can't always be helped. </li>

<li>I try to keep fit but it tends to come in bursts followed by days of just a daily walk.</li>
  
<li>Despite being in a desk-job I'm always happy to do manual, pysical work in the fresh air... and not too phased by a seemingly monotonous job, cold starts or wet weather (provided I'm well-attired in all the warm layers, jackets, buffs, thermals and muddy hiking boots!)</li>
  
<li>I'm bound by the Civil Service Code not to say certain things online and find it exceedingly tough - my absence from certain political discussions is not a sign of disinterest!</li>

<li>Adjectives: tall and keen (if I'm allowed just two!)</li>
</ul>
