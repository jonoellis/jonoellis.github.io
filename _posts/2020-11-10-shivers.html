<p>Bands will always have great performances but there's a special place in my heart for perfect live performances of amazing tunes which were captured on film. Here are a few tracks with multiple versions, each one of which is totally killer, which have been stuck on repeat for me recently.</p>

<h2>San Fermin - Sonsick</h2>
<p>Rae Cassidy only had a brief period as vocalist for San Fermin but she absolutely owns this track, be it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K9gjhbT7xs">behind a tiny desk concert</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCEqNcMeW8g">in the studio</a> or even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzxNQyTxLYQ">walking about</a>! This is is my personal fave - the brass production is on point and the vocals are sublime:</p>

<h2>Frightened Rabbit - Poke</h2>
<p>Painful as it is I've had the Belle Angele and Queens Hall FR gigs in my head a lot lately - both were awe-inspiring but sadly one that seemingly wasn't captured at all and one that was captured terribly! Home crowds, sweaty and insanely loud. Sure there are better recordings... but...</p>

<h2>Bon Iver - Heavenly Father</h2>
And then there's Bon Iver. Justin Vernon, The Staves and Sydney Opera House. So much love for this. There's no denying that this is a song with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG8jY0EhfUE">multiple amazing versions</a>, including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5rKg_taM0">one-to-one that's full of passion and nervous energy</a>, but this one is my favourite:

<p>There are of course others... and so I'll inevitably return to this to add a few more.</p>

<h2>Bonus...</h2>
<h2>Hope & Social</h2>
<p>We had the immense pleasure of being inside the tent at Underneath The Stars when one of the biggest thunder storm downpours I've ever seen hit. Hope & Social had their set royally screwed over with stop-starts but they were finally allowed to return to the stage to conclude their set once the lightning passed and the possiblility of us all being frazzled had faded. I missed recording it as my phone didn't work, but thanks to the power of the internet a short clip exists:</p>
