<p>Bands will always have great performances but there's a special place in my heart for perfect live performances of amazing tunes which were captured on film. Here are three tracks with multiple versions, each one of which is totally killer, which have been stuck on repeat for me recently.</p>

<h2>San Fermin - Sonsick</h2>
<p>Rae Cassidy only had a brief period as vocalist for San Fermin but she absolutely owns this track, be it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K9gjhbT7xs">behind a tiny desk concert</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCEqNcMeW8g">in the studio</a> or even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzxNQyTxLYQ">walking about</a>! This is is my personal fave - the brass production is on point and the vocals are sublime:</p>

<h2>Frightened Rabbit - Poke</h2>
<p>Painfull as it is I've had the Belle Angele and Queens Hall FR gigs in my head a lot lately - both were awe-inspiring but sadly one that seemingly wasn't captured at all and one that was captured terribly! Home crowds, sweaty and insanely loud. Sure there are better recordings... but...</p>

<h2>Bon Iver - Heavenly Father</a>
And then there's Bon Iver. Justin Vernon, The Staves and Syndey Opera House. So much love for this. There's no denying that this is a song with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG8jY0EhfUE">multipleamazing versions</a>, incuding a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX5rKg_taM0">one-to-one that's full of passion and nervous energy</a>, but this one is my favourite:

There are of course others... and so I'll inevitably return to this to add a few more.
