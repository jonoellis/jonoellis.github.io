July's been a good month (aside from EPIC hayfever). I've had some leave spending lots of great time with family, some fab activities - including some Munro climbing and coasteering! - and I'm about to head to Underneath The Stars music festival. What a win!


* [kid - Stephen Wilson Jr.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daUGaBj0WFc)

	 Songwriting genius. Coming to Glasgow later in the year and already sold out. Year to be young 1994 is a nostalgia trip too.


* [I'm Just Ken (Cover) - GWAR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE_ju8eWTS8)

	 In amongst the costumes, the performance, the satire and the silliness it's easy to forget that this is a band built on extreme musicianship and smart lyric writing. 


* [Septuor No 2: Andante - Mimart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTkNVmP4jq0)

	 The kid played this at an orchestra concert and it was so satisfying - the two genres of sombre fanfare and upbeat dance are lovely.


* [Call Me (Blondie Cover) - The Last Dinner Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiCt0n-lqys)

	 Spot on cover. Joyous. The tone/texture on the vocals is amazing! And their cover of Sparks' [This Town Ain't Big Enough For The Both Of Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFjaDMaHP5k) is so on brand!


* [Patterns - Laura Marling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSeJqLyeCeE)

	 A beautiful, lush song with such satisfying chord changes. 


* [All Now - The Staves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFAed18vxQw)

	 I've been listening to The Staves for a few years and I think this might be their best track to date - it's got so much drive to it.


* [Liffey - Pillow Queens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0EjlDqqH84)

	 Fantastic close harmonies, heavy distortion and a song that sounds like it's a forgotten 90's anthem.


* [Boum! - Charles Trenet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFu58li2KJ4)

	 Silliness but catchiness too (although not as iconic as [La Mer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXQh9jTwwoA))


* [Solid Ground - Ms. John Soda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPdE8Mxq9xo)

	 This song made me thing of Orisinal games. It's slow, indie+electronica. Relaxing and a little sad. 


* [Ocean - Moses Yoofee Trio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnKGjSSu2xU)

	 Some very cool jazz rythms. 


* [Bridge to Hawaii - Tacocat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gtz14SV8Nvw)

	 Vintage but somehow new punk to me.


* [Sandar - SHHE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU43SaZvdOw)

	 Ambient sounds from Scotland - very relaxing and enchanting.


* [High School Boyfriend - Mandy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwE6hWAug0M)

	 Kinda Pixies-esque. 


* [Vampire Empire - Adrianne Lenker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEIF-Z9QInk)

	 I blogged [Big Thief](https://ellis.scot/2023/11/november-nocturnes/) last year, nice to rediscover this track and listen to the whole album. 


* [Frenzy in a Far Off World - CZARFACE, Frankie Pulitzer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ8CSwTX5wU)

	 Tom Hardy. Rapping. Definitely worthy of a space [on my list!](https://ellis.scot/category/actors-who-can-sing/)
