Lille street art was spread far and wide but had some great works. I loved walking through many back streets and spotting some cool murals, pavement mosaics and various other art and drawings. The most striking pieces were a series of shopfronts illustrated of cats and dogs riding bikes by @grps_arts. I kept my eye out for high up monkey heads and spotted a handful - I'm sure if I had longer there must be dozens! Nature highlight was the citadel park, gallery highlight was La Piscine - an art gallery in an old swimming pool - and the randomness highlight was the Decathlon B'Twin complex.
