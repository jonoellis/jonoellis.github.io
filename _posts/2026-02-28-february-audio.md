Walks, board games (Arkham, more Arkham, and Aliens: Another Glorious Day in the Corps) and many meals with friends, Gumtree bike purchase win, small but stressful car scrape due to crap parking situation, Arnold Clark being the most farcical garage to deal with ever and causing so much stress and 4 trips to the garage later still haven't fixed our car, a glorious wintry trip to the #cabin, catching sight of an A400 flying at 150ft, stacking a logshed and an awesome snowy hillwalk with the kid - what a month!


* [Ruins Of The Future - Jelle Dittmar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj9axspMqJc)

	 The video is entitled "Double Bass String in Drainage Pipe" and that doesn't describe the wonderful complex sound that Jelle has created - soundtrack music in the best way. Genius. 


* [you and forever - Bleachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ox7VKVzqU)

	 Something of a grower. 


* [Fade Into You (Mazzy Star cover) - O'Keefe Music Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axNVugAQ3jI)

	 Kids these days, eh?


* [My Electric Guitar Is A Toy Piano (WIP) - Simon The Magpie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzL6apSipzk)

	 As as been said before, I'm a huge fan of seeing work in progress and it's great to hear Simon The Magpie show not only how he creates a track but also how he creates an instrument and works the track around the sounds he can make. 


* [Access Point - Audiomachine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKbBZOH6dtY)

	 I've been trying so hard to move the needle on what I can do at the gym, to do more than 1k on the Nordic ski machine, to be able to lift some weights, to be able to run 5k in under 30 mins. I listen to a lot of podcasts normally but to up the energy I tried a lot of techno and metal before spending this month with a [warrior playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0KlmML0kd7ICuZqmokA306?si=Ix-LywecR2e7J-spPUkJyg). It does have such gems as Sunshine by John Murphy and The Kraken by Hans Zimmer


* [Such Great Heights - CHVRCHES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzx26hNWRl4)

	 One of my favourite bands covering one of my favourite songs - perfection. And if the new CHVRCHES album is coming our way this year then woohoo to that. Also, I'd love to be at the CHVRCHES + Robert Smith Teenage Cancer Trust concert at the Royal Albert Hall this month. Also also, don't forget [Ben Folds' cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xu3Y9PRj1M).


* [Minnesota Nazis - NOFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6s6VEJxrU)

	 Old punks, new music.


* [Views - Marika Takeuchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYT8UMIqA_M)

	 Glorious new piano music.


* [When You Said Goodbye - The Cords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLBnF6tks4Q)

	 Crap video audio but check them on [Bandcamp](https://thecordsband.bandcamp.com/album/the-cords-2). A dreamy 90s sound.


* [Killing in the Name (Rage Against The Machine SKA-CORE COVER) - Ska Tune Network](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQE9ROEkQSQ)

	 The revolution will be soundtracked with amazing covers.


* [Still Waiting - STVW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyE0xG4vzH4)

	 Punk-Rave covers? Here for it! [Dear Maria, Count Me In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzPvh509Bo0) also bangs.


* [Free - Florence + The Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui8kUKuLBaU)

	 This hits pretty hard. And Bill Nighy as anxiety personified is on point.


* [Requiems - Joe Hearty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74NGiGQ6nXI)

	 This song's a bop - sounds like Mika visiting a country house with The Divine Comedy.


* [House featuring John Cale - Charli xcx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgp7wlBfASA)

	 Bleak.
