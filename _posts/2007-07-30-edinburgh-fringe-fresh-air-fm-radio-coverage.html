<p>I have just received an email from my friend Craig, one of the presenters on Edinburgh's student radio station Fresh Air FM, telling me that they will be covering the Fringe Festival this year. Live festival coverage from 2pm until 8pm every day of August (and Craig will be on air on Monday 6th and Wednesday 8th between 2pm and 4pm).<br />
For more information (and to listen live) check out <a href="http://www.freshair.org.uk/">Fresh Air FM</a>.</p>
