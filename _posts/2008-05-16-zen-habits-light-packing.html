<p>I just saw this <a href="http://zenhabits.net/2008/03/36-great-tips-for-keeping-travel-as-simple-as-possible-and-two-poems/">post on Zen Habits</a> - given that my rucksack for a weekend trip home is heavier than it was for a 2 day hike I think that I maybe have something to learn from it. My back agrees with the sentiment of their poem as well: â€œHe who would travel happily must travel light.â€ - Antoine de Saint-Exupery</p>
