<a href="http://laughingsquid.com/">Laughing Squid</a> went on a tour of <a href="http://laughingsquid.com/a-tour-of-etsy-an-online-marketplace-for-handmade-goods/">Etsy's HQ</a> and took some cool photos of their offices and some of the cool things they've got hanging on their walls. Faux taxidermy and the like. Seconds after reading about this and thinking "wow - I need to get me some stuffed toy heads and mount them on my wall" I found this post which says "I am SOOO going to do this when I get back home this weekend". The link takes us to Stuft Aquaintances (sic) with some crazy stuffed animal heads available to purchase. I particularly like "Mortimor":</p>
