<p>The start of 2013 has been an awesome time for me finding new music - something that I'm very grateful for as I've been spending long hours doing some somewhat monotonous tasks at work. I love finding new music a lot and it's something I can best liken to people who like collecting things - it becomes something that's not really an obsession, more something that's just a baseline in the psyche. I'm not one of those people who stop liking a band/singer/author/comic/whatever when they become popular - recognition is the reward for years of hard work for most artists. I'm also someone who tries not to idolises people - I know that the people that I admire have their flaws just like everyone else - and I don't know if that's the reason but I try to seek out new music... and as a result my taste is definitely being expanded over time. Anyway... here are some highlights of bands/tunes/albums that you need to check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 14px;">Frightened Rabbit have a brand new album out! :) Without question these guys are my favourite band and Pedestrian Verse doesn't disappoint. I went to the HMV in-store to see them play last week and was impressed as always. It feels even more developed than previous albums and I love the approach of using the whole band to write songs together. My favourite tracks are probably <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0y78C91B3U">Nitrous Gas</a> and Late March, Death March. </span></li>
<li>Chvrches: New single <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4nS5BYkHow">Recover</a> is fab - lots of girly Scots-accented vocals and strong electronic backing. I can't wait to hear the EP/LP/album.</li>
<li>HAIM: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dtIjyG9gTg">Don't Save Me</a> is more elctro-pop of a less grungy/more polished nature.</li>
<li>Kate Boy: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raqxctNC04k">Northern Lights</a> is good, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsogYOSgLKs">In Your Eyes</a> is fantastic. Yet more electro-pop but a little more chilled out than Chvrches.</li>
<li>Sweet Sweet Moon: This is really more of a rediscovery - I first saw the awesome "<a href="http://theyshootmusic.at/semi-acoustic-video-sessions/sweet-sweet-moon/">They Shoot Music</a>" video a few years ago but didn't realise that Sweet Sweet Moon had an <a href="http://sweetsweetmoon.bandcamp.com/album/pompidou">album</a> out. The album is good but lacks the rawness and power of the street performance of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhmjLdX1aRw">Psalm For The Elks Lodge Last Call</a> - I'm still stunned by the simultaneous singing and violin playing.</li>
<li>The Weakerthans: The Sweet Sweet Moon cover of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4__MS-Ode4">Psalm for The Elks Lodge Last Call</a> led me to the original band, The Weakerthans - a band who have a sound comparable to The Wallflowers if you imagine Ben Gibbard singing for them. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgJ6soX18R8">Left &amp; Leaving</a> is well worth a listen.</li>
<li>Katy Bar The Door: It seems like things haven't gone the way the band wanted (presumably to do with a record contract) so the end result is that the band's album wasn't really released with the triumphant fanfare that it deserves... but it's out and I guess that's the main thing as a listener. One of my favourite tracks from <a href="http://kbtd.bandcamp.com/">Orienteering</a> is the track <a href="http://kbtd.bandcamp.com/">The Nearly Men's Society</a> (possibly slightly apocryphal, possibly I'm reading too much into it!) - something about this song just sounds so quintessentially Scottish. The whole album is fantastic and is really well finished - I wish these guys all the best for the future, they definitely deserve more people to hear their greatness.</li>
<li>SONOIO: How I hadn't heard of SONOIO until last week I have no idea. Anyway, SONOIO is a solo project of Alessandro Cortini (part of the Nine Inch Nails lineup) and that's all you need to know. Much awesomeness. Especially on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4HT1Mu7zNk">Enough</a>.</li>
<li>Fake Major: It's sad to say goodbye to a band like <a href="http://endor.bandcamp.com/album/endor">Endor </a>(especially since it seemed like they had so much more to give) but the news of a new band, a new track (<a href="http://vimeo.com/groups/canon5d/videos/59337824">Little Researcher</a>) and a record label is all very much a positive.</li>
<li>The Antlers: I've been rediscovering The Antlers (so not really new music) but if you haven't heard Bear you really should!</li>
</ul>
