<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tQX4tl-Xps">Langhorne Slim</a> (the lead singer of the band Langhorne Slim) has a nice chilled out acoustic sound but it's the warm fuzzy, bluesy, Hammond organy sound that <a href="http://www.myspace.com/langhorneslim">Langhorne Slim</a> (the band) brings to these songs that really makes songs like "Say Yes" and "I Love You, But Goodbye" sound special. Check out their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/langhorneslim">MySpace</a> to get the full sound. </p>
