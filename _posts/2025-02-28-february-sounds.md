* [The Weather - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zTFFgT3Prs)

	 Lawrence rocked in Glasgow. Thank you for coming to Scotland Lawrence!


* [All Apologies - Nirvana](https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjf1VKZkkBs?si=hGaL4jJR4vNr5XYG&amp;start=504)

	 So sad that LA was hit by such terrible fires and that so much tragic human, culture and climate loss has happened. Thankful that little bits of good have come from it. 


* [Over At The Frankenstein Place - Rocky Horror Show Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYZOFZrghqE)

	 I'll never forget seeing the Rocky Horror show on stage for the first time. I didn't know about this performance but it's so so so good. Every song is amazing and I have a special love for Over At The Frankenstein Place. Anthony Head, Stephen Fry and Richard O'Brien all on stage at once!


* [When The Dark Dresses Lightly - Aurora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md4yIaUa7uA&t=744s)

	 OOOFT the energy on this track is off the charts!


* [She Used To Be Mine - Sara Bareilles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53GIADHxVzM)

	 Magic At The Musicals loves this track... rightly so.


* [A Prayer - Madeleine Peyroux
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhY4m6TFVmM)

	 Pretty funeral.


* [Ankles - Lucy Dacus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcW_-uxy6dQ)

	 The kid got tickets, whole fam have been enjoying. 


* [Already Met You - Superfine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N389H25hMFM)

	 Passed the one-third mark of the Buffy rewatch (and, indeed, first watch for a lot of them) and this song is a banger.


* [Teenage Love - Katie Gregson-MacLeod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVeisuzrfh8)

	 Dreamy, poppy, sad, happy - teenage love.
