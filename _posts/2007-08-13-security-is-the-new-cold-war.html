<li>The Diagram / LeisureArts have a fantastic visual display of all of the things which were said to be "the new" something else and the way that they flow from one to the other. My favourite one is "Security is the new Cold War". So... I think that the internet is the new popcorn. </li>
<li>I took a look at <a href="http://artzmania.com/">Artzmania</a> which is a pretty ezine all about web 2.0 sites (available for download here). Mostly this ezine is just there to show that 2.0 = shiny. <a href="http://textplates.com/">Textplates</a> get a mention - they do pretty good templates for websites (although they don't appear to have their coolest template - their own site - available for download).</li>
<li>One of my colleagues just sent me a link to a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOad0FU9zF8">music video</a> for a Borders musician who stood for election in the Scottish elections this year - turns out that I've met him a few times at Hawick High school without knowing. He wears full Highlander gear (kilt <em>and</em> Claymore) wherever he goes. Cool!</li>
<li>The final random thing for today is the E<a href="http://www.ecodigital.co.uk/estore/index.php?main_page=product_info&#038;products_id=66">co wind up media player</a>. 1 minute of winding buys you 40 minutes of audio play time and if you feel like it you can wind for about 30 mins and max out the battery with 20 Hours of playback. You can buy it now and the video player supports all the major formats (and it even has a radio for when you get bored of your own music or want to listen to some news). At Â£170 it's not even particularly expensive and very eco friendly (apart from the production) although it is nowhere near as cute as the <a href="http://www.iteddy.com/">iTeddy</a>!</li>
