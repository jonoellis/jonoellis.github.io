<p>I started a board game idea a fair while ago - it's an okay idea so I thought this would be a good time to document it as I'm nowhere near in the frame of mind to power through to finish it (mostly because I'm wanting to focus on writing, partly because it's going to take an age to draw it all!). Instead, I thought I'd document where I'm up to and leave it here for now - I might come back to it in the future.</p>
<p>So... DR. M'S COMBINE-O-TRON is a game for kids, and it combines THREE GAMES IN ONE (hence it being a little time-consuming to design). The three games are based around a pack of cards and a bag of hex tiles that get placed on a grid.</p>

<ul>
<li>Race to the middle</li>
<li>Who's missing?</li>
<li>Combine-O-Trumps</li>
</ul>
