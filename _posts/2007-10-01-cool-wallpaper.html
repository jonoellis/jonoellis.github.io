<p>This is a really cool idea - a simple wallpaper which gives your room a million frames to put photographs, drawings, printouts, notes, sticky notes, letters or magazine cuttings into. The same website also has a very cool wallpaper for people who have time to read their walls - French phrase book wallpaper. I think the frames one would look particularly good in our hall.</p>
