Last week I clicked through a genre of music in Bandcamp, listened through a bunch of albums and found one I really liked, something that happens to me most days to be honest. But the artist was one that I realised I was reading about synchronously in another tab as I started listening to the band - spoken word poet Shane Koyczan, who appeared at this year's TED talks. </p>

<p>The album is all about bullying and growing up and mental health and self and is really worth a listen - the track "Remember How We Forgot" is a truly beautiful song.</p>
