So I carved something! It bares almost no functional resemblance to its namesake the "spoon", but I learned skills and stuff and I'll definitely carve something else again soon! Skills learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>To not cut or friction burn yourself </li>
<li>To inspect the wood before starting to cut</li>
<li>To spend time making a good rough version with an axe</li>
<li>To choose a good bit of wood</li>
<li>To use an actual spoon as a template!</li>
</ol>
