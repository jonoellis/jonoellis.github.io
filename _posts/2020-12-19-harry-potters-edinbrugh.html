<div>In a slow escape from Google products I'm saving a few of my old My Maps - this was an old one that I thought was fun to hold on to. Harry Potter's fantastical world was imagined by JK Rowling in her native Edinburgh. This map points to some of Edinburgh's magical places which might well have influenced the writer.</div>
