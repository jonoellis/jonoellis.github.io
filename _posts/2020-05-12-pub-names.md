# English Pub Name Generificator Chrome Extension

I had this idea ages ago and wanted something to fill a weekend afternon so... this is just a dumb Chrome Extension to replace common English pub name text with something a little more generic/silly - code is from [TreeHacks](https://www.treehacks.com/) [Hackpack @ TreeHacks 2019 Cloud-to-Butt Chrome Extension](https://github.com/TreeHacks/hackpack-chrome-ext) and lists of common English pub names, [especially](https://www.pubsgalore.co.uk/stats/pubs/pub-names/). The extension is ugly and will replace words all over the shop so sorry if you're called George Bell, Victoria Fox or, indeed, Dragon Hammer! None of this is very serious so feel free not to install, comment or care - just something to spend time on during the pandemic lockdown!

## Turning it in to a Chrome Extension
Get the code here: [https://github.com/jonoellis/Pub-Name-Generificator](https://github.com/jonoellis/Pub-Name-Generificator) and then you'll need to download the files and pup them in to Chrome - instructions are [here](https://github.com/TreeHacks/hackpack-chrome-ext).

## Replacements
I used this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U0PUWbHSyKcI_5kytN0jn-_t79_WeC9tLUDOpoSNAUA/edit?usp=sharing) to help me and the replacements for version 1 are as follows - they are silly and need some work:
