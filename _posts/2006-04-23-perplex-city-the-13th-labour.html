<p><a href="http://www.perplexcity.com/">Perplex city</a> players (including me) are trying to break some really tough encryption. This is one of the biggest maddest things to come out of this revolutionary Alternate Reality Game (ARG). So... please can you lend a tiny bit of your computer to help. A combination of puzzle cards, storytelling, and live events, the game has thrown some incredibly complex tasks at the players - including a card called 13th Labour. This high-scoring card requires the decoding of an RC5-encrypted plaintext which, to quote the designer of the game, "would take about 30,000 computers running in tandem several months to solve". Code-minded players have created a client, compatible with Windows, OS X, and Linux, to attack this task - and are seeking people to run this software on their computers.<br />
