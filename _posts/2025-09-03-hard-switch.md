You should read [Owen D. Pomery's graphic novel "The Hard Switch"](https://owenpomery.com/sci-fi). It's a gorgeous book with a great story. The world-building is lush, full, quirky. I'd read much more about these characters and what they get up to next. I've got [a print of Owen's](https://cdn.myportfolio.com/7635fe07e355c3780ec7eea643e2c8ba/4988dcd2-a1cb-498d-bea9-b7e91b10325a_rw_1920.jpg?h=aefc1954c30f3d8d40db4842f6afcec5) on my hallway wall. His [Kiosk drawings](https://owenpomery.com/kiosk) ([pdf](https://odpomery.gumroad.com/l/uvpcg?layout=profile)) are so cool. The one image that captured my interest most was a device that is likely not something that would be buildable by someone like me; a quirky shaped tablet. Sadly edgeless monitors in custom shapes, magnetic edlgess clip-together monitor components or even cuttable display components aren't - yet - something available on Pimoroni. Maybe one day!

Go read  [The Hard Switch](https://owenpomery.com/sci-fi)!
