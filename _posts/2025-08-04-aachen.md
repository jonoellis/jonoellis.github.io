Aachen is graffiti and stickering gold. 
The whole place has high chaos energy: grubby in places, a fair bit unkempt, lots of construction and at the other end of the scale the spa is a wonder to behold. It's always fun seeing random street furniture - the "is it a burn or is it a drain... Probably a drain... But it opens up and is a feature of the children's play park" drain, the elaborate fire hydrants, the back steet car park where 2 cars ramp on to steep ramps then get **tipped up** so that 2 others can get pitched down into a pretty steep ditch, the on-street vending machines (Tonies for the kids, ciggies and Durex for the adults). Madness. Wonderful madness. I especially loved this piece of street art by [MinaJoe](https://minajoe.com/de/).
