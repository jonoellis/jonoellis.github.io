I’ve been experimenting using <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch.com</a> recently - it’s an amazingly powerful tool hidden in a humorous skin. Like Heroku and similar tools, sites/apps get spun up without you needing to know anything about the infrastructure stuff that’s going on in the background - the bit that makes Glitch special is that you can remix other people’s code really easily, and again, spin it up quickly with it’s own subdomain. Not knowing what project to start with I made another interactive story - this time as a little bit of fun for Ruth’s birthday. <a href="https://interactive-storytelling.glitch.me/">Happy birthday Ruth!</a> <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/interactive-storytelling">You can remix the interactive story here</a> and <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/interactive-storytelling">view the source here</a>.

(You can read my past story experiments <a href="https://ellis.scot/2017/06/interactive-story/">here</a> and <a href="https://ellis.scot/2017/12/christmas-story/">here</a> and there's something WAAAY more exciting in the works at the moment!)

Let me know if you have a play around!</div>
