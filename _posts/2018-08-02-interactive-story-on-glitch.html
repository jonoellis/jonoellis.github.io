<div><strong>Updated 2025-05-24:</strong><a href="https://mastodon.scot/@jonoellis/114555562589179611">Unfortunately beloved Glitch.com is closing down so I'm rescuing little code projects of old</a>. An evolution of one of the projects was linked to below so I've tidied the text and added the story here.</div>

<div><strong>Original 2018-08-02:</strong>I’ve been experimenting using <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch.com</a> recently - it’s an amazingly powerful tool hidden in a humorous skin. Like Heroku and similar tools, sites/apps get spun up without you needing to know anything about the infrastructure stuff that’s going on in the background - the bit that makes Glitch special is that you can remix other people’s code really easily, and again, spin it up quickly with it’s own subdomain. Not knowing what project to start with I made another interactive story - this time as a little bit of fun for Ruth’s birthday. Happy birthday Ruth!</div>

<div>(You can read my past story experiments <a href="https://ellis.scot/2017/06/interactive-story/">here</a> and <a href="https://ellis.scot/2017/12/christmas-story/">here</a> and there's something WAAAY more exciting in the works at the moment!)</div>

<div>Let me know if you have a play around!</div>

<div><strong>Completed Christmas 2020</strong></div>
