Having been a big Lego fan from forever I'm always just a little bit excited when I see a Lego creation that does something a bit crazy or unusual - even though I know that there are <a href="http://peeron.com/">millions of sets and pieces out there</a>. I also quite like things that are minimalistic so when I found this rather basic <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bumcrush/2097001384/in/photostream/">moon habitat base thing</a> by <a href="http://www.zemi.net/?p=350">Jon Palmer</a> I was quite excited. It's sort of like a classier version of this <a href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=218898">moon base</a> <a href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?i=218897">thingy</a>; part of his inspiration came from these amazing <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2007/09/10/lego-towers-by-bjarke-ingels-group/">Lego towers/hills</a>. It also looks strangely like the beautiful photograph "<a href="http://swissmiss.typepad.com/weblog/2008/01/michel-bonvin-p.html">Siviez</a>" by <a href="http://www.michelbonvin.com/">Michel Bonvin</a>. Jon's blog is rather cool and one of it's best features is the  <a href="http://www.zemi.net/?cat=24">"Lego Bento" category</a> which is a "is a single serve portion of some of the best LEGO creations on Flickr and Brickshelf" which really is rather sweet. Of course every cool idea comes with a cool logo and Lego Bento is no different:</p>
<p>Anyone looking for mighty cool looking futuristic transportation options should check out <a href="http://www.izmojuki.com/">Izmojuki </a> - especially the CT44 and the MVR5. The are drawings rather than Lego but I think that the time needs to be spent making these dreams a reality! </p>
