<p>Our daughter can't have dairy. She's not vegan - she'll plough through her weight in spicy chicken wings or my weight in bacon rolls - but milk and milk products make ill. She's only six so we try hard to make sure that she doesn't get treated differently and still gets a choice of things to eat. Life's hard enough without having a food complex. Most places this is fine - whether we're at home or travelling we've found great food and lots of good choices for an adventurous young foodie. That is until we get to chain coffee shops.</p>
<p>The mini one's swimming lessons happen near a Starbucks and last weekend we popped in for a rare post-swimming treat. I was disappointed to hear from the Starbucks staff that there's not a single Starbucks sweet, cakey foodstuff <strong>of any kind</strong> which doesn't contain dairy. The six-year-old wasn't surprised and told me Costa was better (known from her elephant-like memory, not her frequent visits).</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown of all dairy-free food available according to the current Christmas <a href="https://globalassets.starbucks.com/assets/e3bc0f1e05ad44d8ad12a8c06bb69296.pdf">Starbucks allergen menu</a> (available <a href="https://www.starbucks.co.uk/quick-links/nutrition-info">here</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakfast products
<ul>
<li>Luxury Fruit Toast</li>
<li>Soy porridge</li>
<li>Dried fruit mix</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Snack bags
<ul>
<li>Almonds, Cashews, Cranberries &amp; Raisins</li>
<li>Smoked Almonds</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impulse range
<ul>
<li>Raw Raspberry &amp; Nut Bar</li>
<li>Peanut and Cashew Bar</li>
<li>Sugar-Free Peppermints</li>
<li>Sugar-Free Spearmints</li>
<li>Sugar-Free Gum</li>
<li>Sweeties</li>
<li>Dark Chocolate Bar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That list seems long but the store didn't have the full Impulse range so didn't have any cereal bars, it wasn't breakfast time and a bag of nuts isn't going to cut it when everyone else wants to eat a bit of cake.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://www.costa.co.uk/nutrition/nutrition-data-sept-2016.pdf">Costa</a>'s menu (found <a href="http://www.costa.co.uk/nutrition/nutrition-data-christmas-2016.pdf">here </a>and <a href="http://www.costa.co.uk/nutrition/">here</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Christmas
<ul>
<li>Vegan Christmas Cake Slice</li>
<li>Gingerbread Biscuit (Jumper)</li>
</ul>

<li>Dried Mango</li>
<li>Gingerbread Biscuit (Lion and Elephant)</li>
