<p>I've listened to "My Sharona" plenty of times before but I've somehow missed out on The Knack's album, "Get The Knack". Wikipedia tells me it was massive and rightly so - it's actually pretty awesome! There are some really great moments and it's certainly worth a listen. What do you think? I think it's a decent inclusion on Kurt's list.</p>
