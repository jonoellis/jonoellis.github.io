* [Sail (Awolnation Rework) - MEUTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4C58lmv1J4)
	 A long-time favourite song getting a rework by a not so long-time favourite brass band? Yes please!

* [Silk Chiffon - MUNA ft. boygenius ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWJMmYcPTR4)
	 I guess it?s inevitable that I watch a bunch of live performances from Coachella and I listened to a bunch of boygenius so MUNA would appear in the mix somewhere. The crowd were absolutely in love with this performance. Great track. 

* [Easy On Your Own? - Alvvays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE5RTfmE0Wc)
	 One from The Skinny (founded in my flat, don?t you know).
