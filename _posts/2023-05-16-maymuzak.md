* [Sail (Awolnation Rework) - MEUTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4C58lmv1J4)	 A long-time favourite song getting a rework by a not so long-time favourite brass band? Yes please!

* [Silk Chiffon - MUNA ft. boygenius ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWJMmYcPTR4)	 I guess it?s inevitable that I watch a bunch of live performances from Coachella and I listened to a bunch of boygenius so MUNA would appear in the mix somewhere. The crowd were absolutely in love with this performance. Great track. 

* [Easy On Your Own? - Alvvays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE5RTfmE0Wc)	 One from The Skinny (founded in my flat, don?t you know). 

* [Main Attraction - Jeremy Renner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL2DcWB994s)	 There's a special place in my heart for actors and actresses who can sing.

* [Secret - Fred Again... & Brian Eno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq_k-62RpWs)	 Brian Eno just keeps cropping up and keeps on doing great stuff. 

* [You And Everybody That You Love Will One Day Die - Slime City](https://youtu.be/ADMXSWmJ6PM?t=520)	 (Also from The Skinny). Also Dial-Up Internet Is The Purest Internet.
