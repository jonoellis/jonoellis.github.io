Here's what's filled my ears this month:
* [Pata Pata - Miriam Makeba (Matt Cherne Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rOr8-IorVs)

Try to get this out of your head!!!

* MÃ©lanie Laurent - En t'attendant

Reminded me of the first time I heard Damien Rice's O - some amazing songcraft on this album. What I don't understand is how it took over a decade to discover it!

* False Flag - Slaves to Chaos 

[Their BART subway gig looked INSANE](https://www.instagram.com/falseflagsf/)

* The 1975 - Being Funny in a Foreign Language

The Jack Antonoff production sails through at a few points on this album.

* Moby - Ambient23

Very good background music but Moby's general crappiness as a human being had passed me by so this won't be getting listened to any more. Suggestions of new alternatives greatly accepted! 

* 60 Songs That Explain The 90s Podcast

This is such a good podcast. No need to listen in order, just dive into a track that you liked and binge the rest from there!

* [prinztronix - Back in the SSRI](https://tiep.bandcamp.com/album/anyone-for-pong)

Came for the song title, [stayed for the epic beats](https://tiep.bandcamp.com/album/pressing-buttons). 

* [Ren - Hi Ren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_nc1IVoMxc)

Biggest find of the month. H/t to [BoingBoing](https://boingboing.net/2023/01/30/discovering-the-intense-refreshingly-unique-music-of-ren.html). The live version of [Chalk Outlines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35yALr_opeg) gave me shivers and [Bongo Bong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQAUupOFarw) is an absolute blinder of a performance!
