![A Philippe Katerine Monsieur Rose statue in Brussels](https://ellis.scot/uploads/2025/2025-08-05-monsieur-rose.jpg)


Brussels feels massive. With basically only about 6 usable hours in the city, first stop was the Atomium. We need world's fairs like the one that brought this mad building to the world. (The fact that after the 1958 fair - and all other fairs - they demolished architectural gems, some of a similar calibre, seems sacreligious but they were only supposed to be temporary and it was a different time). The Atomium is a work of art. I love that it was conceived, built and preserved. 

Hatred and hostility towards all humans - pedestrians, scooters, bikes and others drivers alike - seems to be a key value of Belgian driver training. Someone shouted at a tram, on team tracks, on a green light, because they wanted to have been out ahead of the tram. It made no sense. I think the hostility comes from the design of the city: Pavements with outside pub seating also - right beside them - have petrol pumps that cars need to drive over pedestrian streets to get to. And so much of the area around Gare Midi seems to forget that people might actually want to walk to the station. (The area outside the station is honestly more of a hole than Warsaw was when I first went there in 2000). But the city also has wonderful buildings. The touristy bits were mega busy but, as always, 2 streets over is peace. 

Architecture took the front seat to street art but I loved finding a couple of Philippe Katerine's Monsieur Rose inflatables and there were a lot of cool stickers and murals.

Car of the day? Citroen Ami. Love these little guys. No need for one but rolling around Edinburgh in it would be a hoot.
