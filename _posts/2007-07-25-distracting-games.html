<p>Today's top two ways to distract yourself at work are <a href="http://www.sudokular.com/">Sudokular</a> and <a href="http://www.shockwave.com/content/shuffle/sis/shuffle.swf">Shuffle</a>. Shuffle is more fun but the Sudokular website looks fantastic.<br />
Enjoy!</p>
<p><font color="#dc143c">UPDATE:</font><br />
Totally forgot the <a href="http://www.bass10.com/flash-games/the-simpsons-wrecking-ball-game/">Simpsons wrecking ball game</a> which comes from the fabulous <a href="http://www.bass10.com/">Base 10 website</a>.</p>
<p>SINCE THIS POST MAY NEVER BE COMPLETE I MAY AS WELL ADD ANOTHER <font color="#dc143c">UPDATE:</font><br />
A game that I haven't tried yet but I think that it fits in well with this post - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1kbwc">1000 blank white cards</a>. It's basically a game where you <a href="http://www.geocities.com/nconner23/bwcards.html">invent your own rules</a> and the game can evolve over time. I think that this would be a great game for ESL teachers.</p>
<p>MAY AS WELL ANNOUNCE THAT I JUST LOST <font color="#dc143c">THE GAME:</font><br />
In case you don't already know what <em>The Game</em> is ....<br />
Rule 1: Everyone is playing <em>The Game</em>. When you find out what <em>The Game</em> is then becomes possible to lose <em>The Game</em>.<br />
Rule 2: The goal of <em>The Game </em>is to forget that you are playing <em>The Game</em>.<br />
Rule 3: If you remember that you are playing <em>The Game</em> then you have lost <em>The Game </em>and must tell everyone.</p>
<p>A while ago I put a link a page up about <em>The Game</em> on the <a href="http://wiki.eutc.org.uk/index.php?title=The_Game">Bedlam Wiki</a> but the whole site appears to be dead now. Pity. But brilliantly I just found out that there is a <a href="http://www.losethegame.com/">website devoted to <em>The Game</em></a> as well as a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/losethegameshop.56969466">Tshirt printed with the rules</a>! Now you too are playing the game - all you have to do is forget. Enjoy!</p>
