<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbXrdOwDlGc">Radiohead - Nude (previously called Big Ideas)</a><br />
After what seems like ages Radiohead have released their brand new DRM-free/record-contract-free/user-picked/download only album "In Rainbows" and it's great. <a href="http://www.inrainbows.com/">Buy it on the Radiohead site</a>. The reworking of Nude is really great and the whole album is much more chilled and accessible than more recent stuff. I like.</p>
<p><font color="red">Update</font>: There are so very many great songs from Radiohead. Top 10 would have to include High and Dry, Paranoid Android and Idioteque.</p>
