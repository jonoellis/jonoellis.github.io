<p>Months ago I decided to brew my first batch of mead. I took the <a href="http://www.rivercottage.net/recipes/traditional-mead-honey-wine/">steps and recipe from Hugh</a> - I've edited the recipe to show what I did and how it worked.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sterilize</li>
<li>Boil then cool 2 litres of tap water and 0.5 litres of pure apricot juice</li>
<li>Pitch the honey - I used 1,875 grams of <em>set</em> honey and I pitched at around 80 degrees c</li>
<li>Stir honey until dissolved</li>
<li>Cool the mix to 20 degrees</li>
<li>Whilst the honey/water mix is cooling take some out and cool it down more quickly then use this smaller batch as a place to pitch your yeast - shake it to get plenty of air in then add a full sachet of <a href="http://www.brewstore.co.uk/vintners-harvest-wine-yeast-cl23-for-high-alc-and-crisp-dry-wines-3986-p.asp">wine yeast</a> and a teaspoon of <a href="http://www.brewstore.co.uk/yeast-nutrient-1501-p.asp">Young's yeast nutrient</a></li>
<li>Pour the mead into a demijohn and shake</li>
<li>Add the yeast mix</li>
<li>Add 24 r<span style="line-height: 1.5;">aisins and some </span>cinnamon</li>
<li>Put an airlock filled with vodka on top and move to a warm dark place</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> After 2 days the airlock was bubbling at a rate of once every 6 seconds</span></li>
<li>After 4 days add another teaspoon of yeast nutrient</li>
<li>Taste after around 1 month when the mead starts to clear and the bubbles slow</li>
<li>Bottle into sterilised bottles after 4 months</li>
</ol>
<p>Doing this I did a lot of research into whether set honey could make mead as the River Cottage site clearly stated not to use set honey. I couldn't find anything so I went for it. I also elected not to boil the honey - I didn't want to kill all the good stuff off.</p>
<p>For the future I'd like to experiment with some of the following flavours:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chilli &amp; Vanilla Pods</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Chocolate &amp; Cherry Juice</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Orange, Star Anise &amp; Nutmeg</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Taste Test: There is no question that this worked. Like 100% worked. I personally think that it tastes nicer than the gold-standard of meads, Lindisfarne Mead! I've shared with a few people and even Ruth was seen voluntarily drinking it!! I'm calling this one a winner and I'm definitely going to rebrew.</p>
