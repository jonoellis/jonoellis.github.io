Here is the first of my "Fifty Shades Of Stout" beers! Things I did differently? I brewed over two nights (which was a really simple process and it saved tonnes of time), I tried adding the priming sugar as a liquid (rather than just dumping in the sugar) and I used my new bottling wand (with great success!).</p>

<p>Tasting notes<br />
Well I got 3 out of about 14 votes for the best stout on the stout table so I'm pretty stoaked about that! There were several comments about the amount of chili (some loved, some hated... it's mellowed out several weeks later though) and some people always seem to like or dislike the peated malt flavour (I love it though so haters can hate). Overall I need to do this again with a teensy bit more treacle flavour - I should have added it to the secondary like I'd originally planned...</p>
