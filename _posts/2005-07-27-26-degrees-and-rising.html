<p>Warsaw is sunny and things are good. The folks here in the office are really interesting to talk to, which is great cos I'm trying to improve their conversation ability. The office is pleasantly air-conditioned - something that will be all the more important if tomorrow is the predicted 30 degrees! I hope that everyone is having a good summer.<br />
Off back to work,<br />
