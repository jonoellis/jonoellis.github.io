<p>Surfer Rosa is an astounding album by the Pixies. Where Is My Mind? is, for me, the standout track (especially since I've been playing it on and off since my days in the band Taper!) but I also think that if the album was realised today it would still be a hit (and would probably be a bit controversial too). The weird thing is that I'd never payed attention to the Nirvana influence but it's really noticable! All in all a top album.</p>
