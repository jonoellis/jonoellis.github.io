<p>Am now living with Ruth in Warsaw and I will be working with her firm as an Business English teacher for the next few weeks. Zakopane was nice but I decided to change plans for various reasons. Warsaw is great and I am looking forward to starting work tomorrow. Weather here is pretty nice. Photos have turned out pretty good so far - more to follow soon. Am looking forward to more games of a game called Fluxx: ever changing rules make card games a bit more exciting! <br /><a HREF="http://www.looneylabs.com/"><img SRC="http://wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Fluxx/Version3/Fluxx3Logo.gif" WIDTH="195" HEIGHT="68" BORDER="0"/></a><br />
