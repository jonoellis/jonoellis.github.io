<p>I'm not going to lie - this isn't my normal listening choice... it's just that I can't get "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2nVJO-4SGxc">Veidiljod</a>" out of my head! The best I can do to describe <a href="http://www.myspace.com/bennihemmhemm">Benni Hemm Hemm</a> is to say that they are like nothing like Sigur Rós playing Ennio Morricone covers with Liam Finn on vocals (because that would just be too weird!).</p>
