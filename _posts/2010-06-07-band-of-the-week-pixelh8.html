<p><a href="http://pixelh8.co.uk/">Pixelh8</a> is one of those dudes that's so talented I wonder when he finds the time to sleep. The tunes are of the variety "chip" and, as such, probably aren't everyone's cup of tea but I urge you to go and listen to "<a href="http://www.myspace.com/pixelh8">You Were Born To Save The World</a>" - it's just such a beautifully orchestrated little tune that I can totally imagine soundtracking an epic scene in a movie. After that you'll want to check out the video of Pixelh8 chip tune busking with his mini amp and his Nintendo DS (t's pretty cool).</p>
