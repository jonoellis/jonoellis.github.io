I've seen a lot of bands. I've been in a few bands. I've realised at some recent gigs that some bands miss some of the basics on how to present themselves on stage. Here's my take on some guidelines for bands. Not every single one needs to be followed but break more than a few and I think it'll come over as a lack of experience (or rudeness):

-   When the gig starts, you get announced, you step up on stage and immediately start playing at least one instrument. It matters not what, but something needs to kick off. Make a sound or a beat and have the audience be made aware that the gig has started; not tuning, not discussing which song, not having a drink, not sound checking. If you don't sound right now then the soundperson should fix it from the desk. 
-   At the end of the first song, you say hello to the crowd over the top of the run-in to song two. A quick hi. Now is not the time to let people drift off - you've got to keep bringing them in.
-   Don't ever announce "That's from our X album" - the audience that doesn't care REALLY doesn't care and those that do already know so don't insult them.
-   Playing 10 tracks? Play at least 9 your main audience can identify as faves.
-   Playing 20 tracks? Play at least 17 your  main audience can identify as faves. More than three tracks from your critically-panned-wildly-different-genre album if the gig hasn't been billed as "an evening of music from our critically panned album" is not your band fulfilling your side of the deal.
-   Smile.
-   Swap instruments as little as possible (unless your schtick is that you are truly multi-instrumental). (Like, **truly** multi-instrumental). Generally, faff is bad.
-   If a piece of music requires a special instrument, think about how you could either play many songs on that instrument OR play that solo/special bit on your normal instrument - the chances of you looking way less cool than you think you look are pretty high otherwise.
-   Really question whether you need to ask the sound tech for anything during the gig. If they are good at their job they're already fixing what isn't working for you and if they aren't good then you need a different technician for your next gig.
-   Unless it's rehearsed, you may only ask the lighting team for in-gig deviation from the lighting plan if it's for house lights and it's because someone in the crowd is having an emergency.
-   Put on your big person pants - if you are anything other than choking then you don't need some runner to bring you a fresh drink. If you forgot, that's on you. 
-   Don't argue with your band on stage. In-band banter whilst on the stage should be minimal (read none). Again, unless this is your schtick. 
-   Don't chat football, politics or gossip. Don't diss the venue, staff, security, other bands, the drummer, your sibling or your ex. You can thank the audience for coming in exceptional weather. Bonus if you have a song that relates to that weather or names their city.
-   State two songs before the end that you have two songs to go, and that you're not wasting a song's space to pretend leave the stage. Be very clear that there will be no encore. 
-   Unless you are a covers band you are allowed one cover only. Check in advance with a few local fans if the one you've chosen will be okay - you don't want to pick something super divisive.
-   Use a silent tuner pedal.
-   Stick to the agreed set list and set times. Turning up on stage early will create rage, and  running over will just result in a flow of people having to get transport or whatever they have on next - don't be that band. 
-   Each member can get a solo. You don't need to name your band members - the lead singer waving their hand in the direction of the soloist and smiling will get the appropriate applause.
-   Play your final two songs. Applause, bow, wave, shout a broad thank you like "thank you to everyone who made tonight happen" and exit the stage. Pre-arrange that your sound person will immediately put on exit music.
-   Treat your fans nicely. 
-   You're being paid - put on the best you can.

What's your take on what bands should do to maintain a good stage presence?
