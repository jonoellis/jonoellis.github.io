<p>Cheers to <a href="http://hpneilson.tumblr.com/post/529248373/this-guy-is-called-andre-duracell-he-uses-his">Mr Neilson</a> for the tip off about this guy - a seriously good find! He's called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/andreduracell">Andre Duracell</a> and he plays drums. He's a one man band but not in the conventional sense - he uses a full drum kit to trigger audio samples/loops and the sound that he creates - ALL ON HIS OWN - is almost impossible to believe. He's playing in Edinburgh on the 25th of May so I'm hoping to see him then.</p>
