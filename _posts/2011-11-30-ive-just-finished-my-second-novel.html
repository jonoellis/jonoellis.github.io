<p>I wrote a novel for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a> in 2009 and, after skipping 2010, I have just completed NaNoWriMo 2011! <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FCmUiDvVXupiwA3JKDxs1CLWi0NtPuLeioSQZa5WWA/edit" target="_blank">Here it is</a> - all 50k words of it! It's a story about NASA sending some astronauts to colonise another planet then at the last minute doing something a little bad. It's sci-fi but should be fairly approachable. Warning: the text is totally uneditited and there are a lot of typos and grammar mistakes... I can't even guarantee that it'll make sense! If the typos really upset you then you can either offer to fix them or stop reading - it's been a long month and I'll probably not edit until January!!</p>
