The trailer for the 22nd Bond <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1klscL-tFGU">Quantum of Solace</a> is really good. Even though I don't really like Daniel Craig's version of Bond anywhere near as much as Pierce Brosnan's I think that the Casino Royale held together so much better than Die Another Day and QOS looks to be a pretty good action movie. Woo.</p>
