Is January the month of fantastic minimal tunes, ambient drone metal and a little catchy pop? Youbetcha. Such a full bag of tunes this month. 


* [Fljótavík - 12 Ensemble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2o4tm6E0U4)

	 A song that I could listen to on repeat forever - gorgeous arrangement. 


* [No Thank You For The Music - Frank Turner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne3DOUoPQig)

	 Bees shouldn't waste their time telling flies that honey tastes better than shit!


* [Cloud Inversions - LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJxHGU8gq1g)

	 Starting 2024 with a new and glorious direction. The EP (on Dropbox and YouTube) is atmospheric and magically musical. 


* [Short Time Skies - Bob Boilen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTRP9X0TUO0)

	 I wish I had the energy of Bob Boilen. He's just retired. He's 70. He invented the Tiny Desk Concert for NPR. And now he's busting out more of his own music and this new track is crazy good. 


* [Anti Loudness - MEUTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UtCQIzgEkI)

	 One of their best yet. STILL gutted that I didn't make it to the Glasgow gig (because of covid fear)


* [Tiny Moves  - Bleachers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmpyfDF_pes)

	 This song is a grower... and then Margaret Qualley (Jack's wife) dances in a gorgeous video that adds layers to the whole thing. (Also, [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xtKhqbNBoY) about Margaret is pretty lush)


* [Lamb And The Lion - The Mae Shi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4QQDW_XS9s)

	 [Throwback to 15 years ago](https://ellis.scot/2008/05/song-of-the-day-187-the-mae-shi/) - as I said then "so much song packed in to a little space". I'd totally forgotten about the band and the track. Listening to their album (having never heard any of their other stuff) was a revalation. 


* [Sounds Like Moths - Amon Tobin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJYnOzcUg0)

	 A classmate gave me a mix CD with a bunch of random tracks in 2004-ish with two artists that stood out - Amon Tobin and greypetcat, I have no idea what happened to greypetcat but Amon Tobin has gone from strength to strength. This track is fantastic. 


* [Greek Islands - Low Tide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k08jOvdvFAU)

	 That sigh/huff at 2:52! 


* [Down Bad - TATYANA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSMryyB315A)

	 I love the contrast of the beat+synths against the vocals on this. 


* [Never Belong - Carla J Easton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGitEmHt9oE)

	 First gig of the year coming up - can't wait! (Also love Weekend Lover and will never be able to get enough of any version of Wanting What I Can't Have).


* [No Caffeine - Marika Hackman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S8NzaZpzpk)

	 Love it when the bass and drums kick in. 


* [May Your Vanquished Be Saved from the Bondage of their Sins (Robert Hampson Remix) - Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7BR1V5JiYU)

	 Turns out that I'm a massive fan of ambient drone metal. Soundtrack of January. I have listened to this so many times over. 


* [Black Tie - Grace Petrie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzU7aIk1dGI)

	 Important messages to hear - go read the comments.


* [Eden - Hania Rani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RcKtr5bGa4)

	 The Tiny Desk concert is the perfect combo of classical, dance and electronica. 


* [Get Back - Margaret Glaspy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cls6rm8g0n8)

	 Powerful vocals and tight drums, guitar & bass. 


* [Ouh là là - Juniore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV_QMwmTRLM)

	 Tremelo surf French pop - ooh la la!


* [Brand New Colony - The Beths & Pickle Darling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRANGq3Pbqs)

	 Gorgeous cover - adds texture to a much-played track. 


* [Fix Me - Mary Jane Dunphe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0e--2KloZw)

	 As the comment says, SubPop have the best artists. 


* [Lose - Boeckner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--Xme1J_jwE)

	 The Arcade Fure vibe is strong on this one!
