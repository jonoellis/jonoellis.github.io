<p>Last night I had a double whammy of Festival goodness with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson">William Gibson</a> <em>and</em> a MidsummernightsTree. What a night! The interviewer was nowhere near as well read, sympathetic or eloquent as Cory Doctorow and the gang were for the <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/08/21/boingboingboing_15_w.html">Boing Boing William Gibson interview</a> but the reading was great. As for the show... it was a fantastic end to the Fringe with break dancing, acrobatics and some weird stuff! Woo!</p>
