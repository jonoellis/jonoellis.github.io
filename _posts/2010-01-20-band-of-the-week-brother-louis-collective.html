<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/brotherlouismusic" target="_blank">Brother Louis Collective</a> rock in their own special way - sometimes they play slow enough so that you can hear every lyric and quiet enough so all the parts can be heard... but sometimes they just rock out. I really like these guys and I can't wait to hear what they all do this year.</p>
