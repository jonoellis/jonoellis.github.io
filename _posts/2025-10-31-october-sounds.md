A lovely holiday in Wales with cavern zip-lining, a fantastic musical theatre showcase performance, a fab gig in Stirling, yet another Corr Cabins #cabin build failure, a recorder playing day, work in-person days, wonderful socialising, a trip to Carlisle, anniversary Splatter art, spoon whittling, garage tidying, Autumnal night-cycling, much taxiing, costume making and some writing!


* [Frost (C) - SUNN O)))](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y20qC3qgpps)

	 [Check out](https://sunn.bandcamp.com/album/life-metal) for monolithic soundscapes and eerie atmospheres. Found these guys via Bandcamp a fortnight ago then, by weird coincidence or algorithmic divining, a week later they signed to Sub Pop. Go them. Orthodox Caveman and Etna are all on my playlist too. 


* [complex - Katie Gregson-MacLeod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9CU9KKnNMs)

	 The kid took me to this gig and it was awesome. Criss-cross-applesauce whole audience sit-down between sets was fun too.


* [She Sells Kosmo Synthesizers On The Sea Shore, Playing The Korg MS10 - LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT-otu2jpS8)

	 And Sam gets an award for best advice song title of the year [KEEPING BUSY THE MOST EFFECTIVE THERAPY I'VE FOUND](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_sWCGt3cUg).


* [Love Me Different - Hayley Williams (with Bleachers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJ2GrF6QJR0)

	 Standout song from the set. Big rotation on this album this week - lots of early Gwen/No Doubt and Garbage vibes.


* [Under The Water - Nation of Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkhieWruMGM)

	 An intriguing set. The band comes over as being so full of themselves, but the sound they make is great, so I guess that's okay?


* [Prepositional Phrase - Aidan Noell](https://aidannoell.bandcamp.com/track/prepositional-phrase)

	 Member of Nation of Language and maker of great synth sounds. 


* [Weightless - Marconi Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfcAVejslrU)

	 It had passed me by that this track was so popular - 140 million streams on this YouTube alone. There is, of course, a [10 hour long version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYnA9wWFHLI). Check out [Silence Is Gliding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tT24zT7OJ8) too.


* [Teeth Grinder - Dead Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIipkutotNg)

	 Huge riffs. Would love to make it to have made the Sneaky Pete's gig. 


* [American Edit - Dean Gray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-sHkc1zxLk&list=PLrpOJGxlgJwIEs9i9a0UjNs6iSS0QomI-)

	 [My second favourite mashup album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Edit) (right after Radio Soulwax 2).


* [Goner - Goodnight Louisa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkss38pGj-o)

	 Love the synth bass.


* [Recovery - Rival Consoles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpHVqod6mB8)

	 A decade old and still gorgeous, dancey and chill all at once.


* [the chase - They Are Gutting a Body of Water](https://theyareguttingabodyofwater.bandcamp.com/track/the-chase)

	 Some intense sounds on this album.


* [I'M FINE! - dodie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tfKfAojoYI)

	 I love the dreamy swell in the middle. [Similarly the scream swell in Smart Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em7ZN-RJw3c). 


* [Comeback - Hi-Lo Jack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95EjSH_02tQ)

	 Music's not a zero-sum game - this genius can exist and not detract from Lawrence and that's a very fine thing.


* [Ghostbusters - JER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnYfIIdKT5k)

	 The ska version we didn't know we needed. 


* [Like I Had Before - Idlewild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk3lKwLN69g)

	 A classic Idlewild sound. Best track on the album by a mile.


* [just (feat. m. sage) - Claire Rousay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBoVavhTuKU)

	 The tags on Bandcamp sum it up: ambient musique concrete.


* [Opening - Essie Jain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FT60eeyBTg)

	 Crunchy harmonics.
