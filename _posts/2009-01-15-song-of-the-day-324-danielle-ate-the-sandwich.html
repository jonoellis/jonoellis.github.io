I only heard about <a href="http://www.myspace.com/danielleatethesandwich">Danielle</a> yesterday on Boing Boing but I'm seriously impressed. Her version of <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=x-kWy7ob4Wg">Rhythm is a dancer</a> <del>requires</del> demands that you to listen to it loud. Despite all of the happy music I can't get away from <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=pKlHHXsDIPY">And She Said</a> - it's hard to describe in words other than the fact that it's beautiful. Cool artist - looking out for more.</p>
