Summer holidays, Glastonbury on the BBC, stressing about the health of others and the fragile state of mortality, work, life, work/life, many loads of washing!


* [As Alive As You Need Me To Be - Nine Inch Nails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sj-FmI5JfA)

	 Still making huge dancy, rocky, industrial sounds. 


* [Vampire (Glastonbury 2025) - Olivia Rodrigo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002f233/glastonbury-olivia-rodrigo)

	 How many decibels was the scream at the end of the set? 


* [Green Light (Glastonbury 2025) - Lorde](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002ff1p/glastonbury-lorde)

	 New album energy. What Was That rocks. 


* [I Want To Be Your Girlfriend (Glastonbury 2025) - girl in red](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fc87/glastonbury-girl-in-red)

	 The crowd surf. Girls. My Girl. I Want To Be Your Girlfriend. 


* [Last Man On The Earth (Glastonbury 2025) - Wolf Alice](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fc16/glastonbury-wolf-alice)

	 Goosebumps.


* [Fucking Wizardry (Glastonbury 2025) - Self Esteem](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fbnh/glastonbury-self-esteem)

	 When the choral/trumpet bit hits, it hits hard!


* [Chaise Longue (Glastonbury 2025) - Wet Leg](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fblb/glastonbury-wet-leg)

	 Still a summer banger.


* [Los Ageless (Glastonbury 2025) - St. Vincent](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fc5p/glastonbury-st-vincent)

	 Manic. 


* [End of Beginning (Glastonbury 2025) - Djo](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fc7v/glastonbury-djo)

	 A billion streams can't be wrong.


* [Nightshift (Glastonbury 2025) - Lucy Dacus](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fbtl/glastonbury-lucy-dacus)

	 When the overdrive/distortion hits. 


* [Leave a Trace (Glastonbury 2025) - Four Tet](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fbmd/glastonbury-four-tet)

	 CHVRCHES!


* [Many Of Horror (Glastonbury 2025) - Biffy Clyro](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002f21h/glastonbury-biffy-clyro)

	 Not their best vocal performance but rich as always


* [Somebody You Loved (Glastonbury 2025) - Lewis Capaldi](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002f21b/glastonbury-lewis-capaldi)

	 Brought the tears


* [Take Me Out (Glastonbury 2025) - Franz Ferdinand](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fbl7/glastonbury-franz-ferdinand)

	 Brought the party. And Peter. 


* [Full Set (Glastonbury 2025) - Weezer](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fbpb/glastonbury-weezer)

	 Weezer Weezered 100%


* [Mr Crowley - Jack Black feat. Roman Morello, Revel Ian, Yoyoka Soma & Hugo Weiss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hm-M8GvgYws)

	 When you compare to the [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3LvhdFEOqs) it's wild. 


* [First Signs Of Intimacy - Quiet Years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6A6npvbuLmg)

	 Only one song on Spotify? Why bother making any more when it's this good. 


* [Seer - Witch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz6CcNJ3mQw)

	 I don't know about this festival, but I do know the camera and sound engineers NAILED IT.


* [Live Aid 1985 - Queen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgdHrpftTjA)

	 Maybe the single most iconic live set ever performed?


* [Mycale Strait - Fionnlagh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0u4a741BAk&list=RDV0u4a741BAk&start_radio=1&ab_channel=Fionnlagh-Topic)

	 Beautiful drones.


* [Ghost - Delivery Service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsXaVpgldI4)

	 You can't tell me this isn't from the 90s.


* [Sisyphus - Hotgirl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigyWk0yblk)

	 Loving the sing-along chorus.


* [anything - Adrianne Lenker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CV1qykq678)

	 "Christmas Eve with your mother and sis; Don't wanna fight but your mother insists" [Big Thief's All Day All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ypvGArgmIk) has also been getting some love this month. 


* [Man Of The House - Rachel Zegler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmZSiTNd5LY)

	 Jack Antonoff writing and production at its finest. The vocals are the cherry on the top. 


* [Pretty Girls - Rene√© Rapp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g4Y5IYY5Mk)

	 The auto harmony is where this song is at. 


* [Swedish Girl - Saga Faye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u65_93N14eI)

	 BBC6 Music played it but not much info on the artist - love the bleepy bloopy bit. 


* [I quit (Album) - HAIM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPV_S3SGdvo)

	 Shame they [only got one song of coverage](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m002fb08/glastonbury-haim-summer-girl) on the BBC but the album is great. Take me back, Down to be wrong, All over me and Gone are all great tracks. 


* [Dylan Thomas - Better Oblivion Community Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1Yz-NyLV90)

	 Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers nailing it. [See also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf-GEnIXPag)


* [What You Doing - Pacifica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCUJuijFNN8)

	 This album is great. Hotel Bar, Fantasies and Change Your Mind all rock. 


* [If It Makes You Happy (Sheryl Crow Cover) - Hamish Hawick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc-wu0ZUvQY)

	 I had to check if the verse lyrics were original or not they are so Hamish Hawk-y. 


* [The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Feat. Black Thought)  - Brian Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oQURjDmaNQ)

	 "You will not be able to block, unfollow, mute or swipe left to disengage with the revolution. It will be immersive, live streaming in its entirety and uninterrupted on every platform But the revolution will not be televised." A glorious take on the Gil Scott-Heron piece.
