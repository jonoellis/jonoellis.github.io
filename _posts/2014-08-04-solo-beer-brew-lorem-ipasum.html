<p>Pun-tastic I know but "Lorem IPAsum" is a play on IPA and the "copy" that websites and books sometimes use before the real text has been written; in my case this IPA recipe started off as a <a href="http://www.craftedpours.com/homebrew-recipe/brewdog-punk-ipa-clone-homebrew-recipe">clone of BrewDog's Punk IPA</a>. When Edinburgh Brewstore homebrew club set the August theme challenge as "IPA" - I imediately though about how Brewdog make their IPA. Punk IPA is a go-to beer, it's always good and it's becoming more and more available (especially around Edinburgh) so why not try and learn a bit more about IPA by trying to copy their recipe? Point 1 - there is no way that this is going to be an exact copy; I have vastly inferior equipment and I could get neither the right hops for the clone recipe nor the right grain so I hope that this doesn't turn into a "Punk'd IPA"! Point 2 - I'm mostly relying on advice from the internet here so who knows how reliable info on the original recipe was!</p>

<p><strong>First taste</strong></p>
<p>This really isn't Punk IPA (colour too dark, too malty and high alcohol flavour) but glad that it worked!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second taste</strong></p>
<p>The opinions at Brew-Club were favorable and I was dead chuffed. :) Two people said to not bother calling it a Punk IPA clone and the different expectations would mean an even better opinion. :) One suggestion was to drop the Biscuit entirely and use 1/2 Golden Promise and 1/2 Lager in it's place or drop the Biscuit to 3-5%. To try next time!</p>
