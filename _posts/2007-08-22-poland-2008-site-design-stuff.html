<p>Ruth's Poland site is now live. The <a href="http://www.phpformgen.com/">phpFormGenerator</a> came in handy - the one I was using for the Clanen site didn't have a capcha so now there is less chance of spam. The designers toolbox is also pretty useful. I couldn't decide which type of <a href="http://www.duoh.com/csstutorials/2levelmenu/index.html">navigation</a> to use but I ended up with going with this one. I really wanted a sli<a href="http://www.sgclark.com/sandbox/minislide/">der</a> but I'll use that idea for the next site that I work on. Like so many <a href="http://digitarald.de/playground/squeeze.html">pretty things</a> many slider menus are a bit traumatic on a 56k model (and given the geographical scope of the site it's not such a good idea to expect broadband in every home).</p>
<p>I love the <a href="http://freeajaxscripts.net/directory/Ajax_Image_Galleries/AJAX_Slideshow/details.html">AJAX slideshow</a> even though it was slightly quirky when I integrated it into my code. There were many <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/06/20/ajax-javascript-solutions-for-professional-coding/">AJAX adornments</a> to look at but I decided that they really weren't needed in this situation. I think that the slideshow is a good compromise between usefulness and <a href="http://www.ajaxrain.com/">prettiness</a>.</p>
<p>For the overall site design there were so many <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/01/12/free-css-layouts-and-templates/">CSS template sites</a> to choose from (<a href="http://www.thenoodleincident.com/tutorials/box_lesson/boxes.html">Little boxes</a>, <a href="http://www.intensivstation.ch/en/templates/">intensivstation</a>, <a href="http://www.mycelly.com/">mycelly</a> and <a href="http://csstinderbox.raykonline.com/">CSS Tinderbox</a> to name but a few) that I was so overwhelmed by the choice (and lack of what I really wanted) that I ended up building the site up from an old tutorial from <a href="http://www.netmag.co.uk/">Netmag</a>.</p>
<p>Ruth's site (which I'm sure will evolve significantly over the next 12 months) is a sub site of the <a href="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/">Borders Exploration Group</a> - be careful though... their site breaks Firefox! Maybe it's time for a <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">CMS</a>!</p>
