<p>With Last FM having released their <a href="http://www.last.fm/bestof/2008">2008 list of top artists, tracks and albums</a> I though I should take a peek at mine to see how their list compares to <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/jonoellis/charts/">what I've been listening to over the past 12 months</a>... As it turns out it's a bit of a mix. I've spent a lot of the year listening to old albums from the same bands that I've been listening to for a few years now (Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, The Arcade Fire, Green Day, Five for Fighting, Muse, R.E.M. and Jonathan Coulton). I've also discovered a few bands this year (even though they didn't have a 2008 album) including Beirut, Gogol Bordello, Stone Sour, Holy Fuck, FDR, Seasick Steve and Jacob Golden. On top of that I've been listening to a ton of new bands and bands with new albums. So... here's my 2008 list of my favourite albums/artists:</p>

<p>I also feel that an award should go to Counting Crows, Snow Patrol, Coldplay and Kings of Leon for producing crap albums yet somehow still getting lots of listens from me!
