Family stresses, the best types of socialising with family and friends, the gorgeous flipside weather of shitty global warming, first multi-day holiday with Ruth and no kid since Obama was in charge, a bunch of trips to Hawick, a recorder playing day, the constant absolute horrorshow of international and national politics, a little Arkham horror, a sponsored hillwalk and a beach clean in the sun... it's been a busy month!


* [The darker side of deep ambient. Music for staring into the Abyss. - Soma FM](https://somafm.com/darkzone/)

	 I had to do some very repetitive but high focus Google Tag Manager work and this helped me through it. DJ Rusty Hodge, I thank you. 


* [Long Sardine - Oxis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ryVF8CLB9w)

	 A little trip for the brain. Found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHExCkfOWNm/) - I think the mix with the Daughter sound is very cool. 


* [Sweet Dreams - DETYB & Eurythmics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_qU8JfuxRg)

	 The original is unstoppable... but the techno's got something else going for it. 


* [Tomorrowland Brasil 2024 set - Charlotte de Witte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFLIztjVaR8)

	 The folks that were there witnessed Techno perfection.


* [Wasting Time With You - Wendlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxRO3tCBZUo)

	 Loving wasting time listening to tunes like this. 


* [Do It With Madonna - The Androids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GemwsucYb9A)

	 This song popped back into my head after at least a decade. So silly but I loved this when it came out!


* [The Otherside - Breaks Co-Op](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkxfDRqXvRs)

	 I watched the Zane Lowe/Brian Eno interview and remembered that Zane was in some bands. [No flint, no flame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdnlKkIq7Rk) is fun but Breaks Co-Op are more where I'm at - I've always been a fan of The Otherside.


* [When I Was Pretty - buffchick](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-_NFI3BjUOM)

	 Country Emo? Great sounds. 


* [Video Call - Bottle Rockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6OJiRZFQLo)

	 Glasgow indie with slightly gothy overtones - another band to hope to see this year some time. 


* [Glycerine (Bush cover) - Allison Lorenzen and Midwife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zF5GQaOzzIo)

	 The guitar distortion, the wash of vocals, the tipsy late-night walk home vibe - gorgeous. It made me rewatch the [Bush Woodstock set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHlN1Hy1bR4) and it's a festival it would have been awesome to have witnessed. 


* [TRØLLABUNDIN - Eivør & Danish National Symphony Orchestra ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne4kFBmDsXY)

	 Spellbound. 


* [Norupo - Heilung](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64CACoHNBEI)

	 Putting "dark" into "dark ambient". I didn't want to fork out £80 for tickets in Edinburgh but it sure looks to have been an intense gig.
