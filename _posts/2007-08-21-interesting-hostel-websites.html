<p>Some hostels try to encourage you to stay with them by spending money creating a good looking website - here are a few of this weeks more <em>interesting</em> finds. Which style do you prefer? <a href="http://www.casadedonpablo.com/">Crazy navigation</a>, a graphic designer's mind on a plate or a calm and <a href="http://hostelbambu.com/">nature based site</a>. Some sites are just <a href="http://www.negamaluca.com/">ugly</a> though.</p>
