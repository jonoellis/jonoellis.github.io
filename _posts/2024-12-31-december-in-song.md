Thanks for taking time to drop by if you've been reading these little music gems this year. It's been a busy old year and has had been soundtracked by so many wonderful tunes. Here are my final few for December:


* [Every Atom - Lanterns on the Lake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ffoQHWjtQ)

	 Gorgeous vocals and slow piano/drums with an insane glitchy guitar solo - what's not to love. 


* [Right Back To It - Waxahatchee
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ps1f7p720FA)

	 It's always interesting how a live performance of a song I've loved can push it to a new level.


* [Something In The Water (Acoustic-ish) - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuzQwix30To)

	 Beautiful. 


* [Girls Make Me Wanna Die - The Aces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FlnXDIbmXA)

	 The Magic is magic too. 


* [Vicious Creature - Lauren Mayberry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXQFFJS94XY)

	 We'd already heard Something In The Air, Shame, Changing Shapes but Sunday Best is another great track and Are You Awake? was a surprise ending that really caps off the album. Well worth the wait and such a shame it didn't get more promotion and love. 


* [Fljótavík by Sigur Rós - VOCES8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsQx8CUUooE)

	 I'd be satisfied in life if I could create a sound this beautiful, a song this perfect, an atmosphere this eerie.


* [Only You - Nouvelle Vague Featuring Mélanie Pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi0y-e1HSnw)

	 Short, to the point and beautifully sweet. 


* [The Avengers Theme - Laurie Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELRaqSzEKew)

	 No, not that The Avengers, the original one. This song came on BBC 6 and reminded me of my childhood. They don't make theme songs like that any more!
