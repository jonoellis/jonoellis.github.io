Big upgrades to my behind the scenes process this month for keeping track of what I've been enjoying listening to... none of which will impact the awesome tunes!


* [Sail (Awolnation Rework) - MEUTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4C58lmv1J4)

	 A long-time favourite song getting a rework by a not so long-time favourite brass band? Yes please!


* [Secret - Fred Again... & Brian Eno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq_k-62RpWs)

	 Brian Eno just keeps cropping up and keeps on doing great stuff. 


* [Silk Chiffon - MUNA ft. boygenius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWJMmYcPTR4)

	 I guess it’s inevitable that I watch a bunch of live performances from Coachella and I listened to a bunch of boygenius so MUNA would appear in the mix somewhere. The crowd were absolutely in love with this performance. Great track. 


* [Easy On Your Own? - Alvvays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE5RTfmE0Wc)

	 One from The Skinny (founded in my flat, don’t you know). 


* [Main Attraction - Jeremy Renner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL2DcWB994s)

	 There's a special place in my heart for actors and actresses who can sing.


* [You And Everybody That You Love Will One Day Die - Slime City](https://youtu.be/ADMXSWmJ6PM?t=520)

	 (Also from The Skinny). Also [Dial-Up Internet Is The Purest Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh_0ESP1AKk).


* [Whole Again (Atomic Kitten cover) - Daði Freyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZMZAJjciTg)

	 Eurovision: Honestly the best track of the night.


* [Blood & Glitter - Lord of the Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I9CYu668jA)

	 Eurovision: (although arguably their cover of Cha Cha Cha is better than either track!)


* [I Wrote A Song - Mae Muller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRaVGKk4k6k)

	 Eurovision: (I loved the singing inside her own head visuals and I love the beat)


* [Carpe Diem - Joker Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDBSIGITdY4)

	 Eurovision: (thought this could have won)


* [My Sister’s Crown - Vesna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag8qxpvTTy0)

	 Eurovision: 


* [Promise - Voyager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agG7ShZGfJM)

	 Eurovision: (sounds kinda anthemic)


* [Queen of the Kings - Alessandra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUHSM_vTqTI)

	 Eurovision: Has a very Ancient Forest Of Elves vibe!


* [Évidemment - La Zarra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdWooN4U6rY)

	 Eurovision: (might have been my fave entry of the night)


* [Mama ŠČ! - Let 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPiY1v3EfNc)

	 Eurovision: The production on this track is nuts - the overlapping choir, lead vocals, synth, drums, opera near the end sounds amazing


* [Cory Doctorow & Rebecca Giblin - Page One Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/40C8vYBqndm9YJeH73EDJy?si=00a67b90f0624440)

	 Chokepoint Capitalism


* [The Fifth Elephant - The Compleat Discography Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6xVRmeq6ZDkvfJC2oj4rYh?si=66ddc3afef2d43a7)

	 One of my favourite ever books


* [Pulp's Common People - 60 Songs That Explain The 90s](https://open.spotify.com/episode/54f6ZIUaIZy30mRiz6y7YT?si=c413df18751a47ed)

	 "He looks like the man who, right there in the 90s, invented the private browsing tab." Rob Harvilla on Jarvis Cocker.


* [The Alcott (feat. Taylor Swift) - The National](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCqoNu36y2o)

	 Not as great an album but still a good album. 


* [Tunes From The Planet Jono - \[Y2K\]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc3-HN0QXHDoK9jvMLwySXhpNS-03qq9Q )

	 Craig found an old mixtape that we made (or maybe he made from my music). PHOTO AND LINKS TO TRACKS AND TRACK LISTING
