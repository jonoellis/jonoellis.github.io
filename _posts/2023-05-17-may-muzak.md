* [Sail (Awolnation Rework) - MEUTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4C58lmv1J4)
	 A long-time favourite song getting a rework by a not so long-time favourite brass band? Yes please!

* [Secret - Fred Again... & Brian Eno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq_k-62RpWs)
	 Brian Eno just keeps cropping up and keeps on doing great stuff. 

* [Silk Chiffon - MUNA ft. boygenius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWJMmYcPTR4)
	 I guess it?s inevitable that I watch a bunch of live performances from Coachella and I listened to a bunch of boygenius so MUNA would appear in the mix somewhere. The crowd were absolutely in love with this performance. Great track. 

* [Easy On Your Own? - Alvvays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gE5RTfmE0Wc)
	 One from The Skinny (founded in my flat, don?t you know). 

* [Main Attraction - Jeremy Renner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL2DcWB994s)
	 There's a special place in my heart for actors and actresses who can sing.

* [You And Everybody That You Love Will One Day Die - Slime City](https://youtu.be/ADMXSWmJ6PM?t=520)
	 (Also from The Skinny). Also Dial-Up Internet Is The Purest Internet.

* [Whole Again (Atomic Kitten cover) - Da?i Freyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZMZAJjciTg)
	 Eurovision: Honestly the best track of the night.

* [Blood & Glitter - Lord of the Lost](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I9CYu668jA)
	 Eurovision: (although arguably their cover of Cha Cha Cha is better than either track!)

* [I Wrote A Song - Mae Muller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRaVGKk4k6k)
	 Eurovision: (I loved the singing inside her own head visuals and I love the beat)

* [Carpe Diem - Joker Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDBSIGITdY4)
	 Eurovision: (thought this could have won)

* [My Sister?s Crown - Vesna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag8qxpvTTy0)
	 Eurovision: 

* [Promise - Voyager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agG7ShZGfJM)
	 Eurovision: (sounds kinda anthemic)

* [Queen of the Kings - Alessandra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUHSM_vTqTI)
	 Eurovision: Has a very Ancient Forest Of Elves vibe!

* [?videmment - La Zarra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdWooN4U6rY)
	 Eurovision: (might have been my fave entry of the night)

* [Mama ??! - Let 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPiY1v3EfNc)
	 Eurovision: The production on this track is nuts - the overlapping choir, lead vocals, synth, drums, opera near the end sounds amazing
