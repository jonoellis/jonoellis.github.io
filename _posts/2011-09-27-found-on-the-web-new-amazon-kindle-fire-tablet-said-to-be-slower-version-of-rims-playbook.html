<p>I give it ten minutes before there is a news headline entitled "New Amazon Tablet Lacks Fire"... you can't go around using names like "Fire" when you're trying to save money on components, surely "Fire" should be the high-end version? Still - it'll be nice to see an iPad competitor that actually has a chance to compete.</p>
