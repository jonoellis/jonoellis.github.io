<p>My wonderful wife <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/">Ruth</a> is this month&rsquo;s host of the <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/">Tinned Tomatoes</a> <a href="http://www.tinnedtomatoes.com/p/pasta-please.html">Pasta Please</a> challenge - this month&rsquo;s theme is <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/pasta-please-cheeseless-wonders.html">Cheeseless Wonders</a> since our house is a dairy-free environment. I went for something with a Scottish twest - haggis pasta. It tastes pretty good although it was a little bit dry - maybe some more tomatoes next time (or eating it when it&rsquo;s fresh, not the next day for tea!).</p>
<ul><li>Pasta (cook until ready)</li>
<li>Spinach - wilt in a frying pan</li>
<li>Haggis from a can - add to frying pan to heat up and break up</li>
<li>Tinned tomatoesÂ </li>
</ul><p>Mix the lot together and enjoy.</p>
<p>Thank you Ruth!</p>
