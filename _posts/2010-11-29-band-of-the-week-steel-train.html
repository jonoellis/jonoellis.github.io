<p>It's weird when I hear about a band that I should have already heard of because they're sort of already quite famous. Steel Train are one of those bands. They have supported loads of other bands (including Tegan and Sara, Ben Folds, Silversun Pickups, - Hanson! -  and the Barenaked Ladies). They've also performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. Unsurprisingly they're pretty good to listen to! Enjoy.<br />
