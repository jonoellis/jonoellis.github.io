<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Wy7gRGgeA">Jonathan Coulton - Code Monkey</a><br />
There are loads of music videos for this song as Jonathan Coulton had a competition for his listeners/fans to make their own ones. The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Wy7gRGgeA">Warcraft based one</a> is pretty sweet but I just like the effort that this guy has gone to with the lip syncing. (If you like the second video then you should probably check out the clip of the Simpsons in World of Warcraft - the ending is a bit weird but I love the idea of Grog Lite - not enough bars sell Grog Lite).</p>
