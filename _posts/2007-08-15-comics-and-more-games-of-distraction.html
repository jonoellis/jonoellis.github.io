<ul>
<li><strong>Distraction 1 (Read MegaTokyo / ponder future Sony products):</strong> The one they call <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/tin_man_/">Tin_man_</a> and I were once very amused by the concept of Sony making anything called a "Killstick" (<a href="http://www.oop-ack.com/mt/art/162.jpg">I just found this pic in my bookmarks!</a>) - from <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com/">MagaTokyo</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Distraction 2 (Do a crossword):</strong> The ultimate online <a href="http://militantplatypus.com/games/gamepage.php?game=crossword">crossword/letters game</a> - I loved these as a kid but now I won't have to spend hours rubbing out my mistakes!</li>
<li><strong>Distraction 3 (Play Ducktales online!!!!):</strong> <a href="http://www.virtualnes.com/">vNes</a> lets you play all of those classic Nintendo games online (on a webpage - not an illegal download!). Ducktales still rocks.</li>
<li><strong>Distraction 4 (go for a taxi ride for fun):</strong> Not strictly a game but the <a href="http://www.citysafari.co.uk/">Edinburgh City Safari Taxi</a> looks like a laugh. I remember seeing some people being really random jumping into taxis in a comedy way on Princes street ages ago... maybe they weren't just crazed tourists!</li>
<li><strong>Distraction 5 (Read XKCD):</strong> The massively amusing <a href="http://xkcd.com/chesscoaster/">XKCD</a> comic have started a trend... sticking the pieces down on a chess board and taking them onto roller coasters just to see what the souvenir picture looks like. Genius.
</li>
<li><strong>Distraction 6 (Play make a new friend):</strong> You can now play the classic text adventure The Hitch-hiker's Guideusing IM!</li>
<li><strong>Coming Soon:</strong> <a href="http://www.gwap.com/">Games with a purpose</a> (from the man who invented the Google image labelling game and the Captcha) are sure to be a hoot when they are finally launched.</li>
