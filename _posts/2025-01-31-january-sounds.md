January themes: storms, Gaiman, Trump, Traitors, radiators, painting and fibre.


* [The Aeroplane - Tim Minchin & Asmara Feik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCYzau2xato)

	 Song of the month. Sentimental in all the right ways. 


* [Julie - Horsegirl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fs9zU1VBebk)

	 Sparce yet every sound is huge. The guitar soloing over the top is fab... and the harmonies are lush. Looking forward to the album.


* [Defying Gravity - Clyde & Gracie Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU37jrvOa9Y)

	 Now that's how to do NYE!


* [Guy Fawkes Tesco Dissociation - jasmine.4.t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efGW4BL-bWc)

	 Great song, great production and Muppet Phoebe is a welcome twist to any music video!


* [Sea, Swallow Me - Cocteau Twins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uWbEe7U3ZY)

	 Hope for the world hearing the youth of today are doing an ear apiece of their AirPods and shared listening to Cocteau Twins in class. 


* [Virginia - Boys Go To Jupiter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWccvJRW1fA)

	 This is one of those songs that an algorithm served up and I couldn't help but bop along. 


* [This Side of the Island - Hamilton Leithauser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuYUelwDOA8)

	 Lead singer of [The Walkmen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asI2DsUPWJ4) - nice to hear this new stuff. 


* [Leaving Home - Yo La Tengo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zapp7p5wKBw)

	 The chilledness of it all. 


* [Back To Black - The Zutons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIpktPgesO0)

	 Covering the artist that made a cover of their song a standard.


* [light dark light - Fred again.. & Angie McMahon
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14NvwgZhzSI)

	 January music without question. 


* [Hold On - Former Champ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRRVrUwwXgg)

	 Love the vocals and the tight Glasgow pop sound.


* [Actor - Goodnight Louisa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy5fAYBUM80)

	 The synth sounds so ritch and the layers of vocals and orchestration near the end is magnificent.
