<p>Since it's the first of December I thought that I could post yesterday's craft project - Martha and I made a Hello Kitty snow globe! Here's how:</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 old jar</li>
<li>Some plasticine to stick your model in</li>
<li>A Hello Kitty (or equivalent) Lego man</li>
<li>Some glitter (don't use the Poundland stuff - it floats!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not sure this needs instructions - stick your character into the plasticine in the lid, fill the jar with water and glitter, attach upturned lid to jar... and enjoy!</p>
