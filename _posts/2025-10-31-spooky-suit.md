For once we had a bit of time to prep for a Halloween party. Possibly inspired by [Dave Fogler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOBXRmOQeKw) (I only found this video again after I'd started painting but I think I watched it months ago so maybe it was swirling round my head) and [Crom](https://crom.ink/about)'s skull mask. The helmet is just some cardboard badly duck-taped and paper-taped together with a duck-tape face. The viewing port is the nose. It's not big enough and the black gauze behind limits the view further. The suit is a cheap Vinted jacked and old pair of jeans. I created a stencil, painted the skulls 2 coats of white, one coat of black features, 3 coats of glow-in-the-dark paint. The glow-in-the-dark paint was a bit shoddy but it's still a cute effect when it works. Overall I wore the skull for about 5 minutes in total but the suit is a win and will be in my wardrobe ready for years to come. Happy Halloween!
