<p>Type the following into Google:</p>
<p>-inurl:(htm|html|php) intitle:"index of" +"last modified" +"parent directory" +description +size +(mp3) "BAND NAME"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?num=100&amp;q=-inurl%3A%28htm%7Chtml%7Cphp%29+intitle%3A%22index+of%22+%2B%22last+modified%22+%2B%22parent+directory%22+%2Bdescription+%2Bsize+%2B%28mp3%29+%22the+beatles" target="_blank">Try that search by clicking here</a></p>
<p>This search lets you find mp3's that people are openly sharing. There may be some legal issues with this and I don't condone using it - but this does show you how powerful Google is!</p>
