<p>The Killers - Everything Will Be Alright<br />
I love the "no copyright infringement intended" comment after almost 6 minutes of stealing clips from the Harry Potter films! This is such a great song in a slightly shivery kind of way.<br />
On a Harry Potter note... having finished the last book (and been happy that the story has been all wrapped up and that the last two films will probably kick ass) I am glad to hear that JK (not Jay Kay) has promised more from the land of wizards. She mentioned in an <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/19935372/">interview</a> that there will be at least one more book with short stories and backgrounds to characters and wizarding families. More information <a href="http://getaway.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=279543">here</a>.</p>
