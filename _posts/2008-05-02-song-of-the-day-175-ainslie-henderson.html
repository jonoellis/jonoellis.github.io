<a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=xiYPExEZNdM">Ainslie Henderson - Fail</a><br />
When I was in the mighty band Taper we supported a band called Suburbia a few times. They were always amazing and we all thought that they were on the brink of something big. Sometimes things are just not to be. Ainslie - after a stint on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HpynQtb5cNg">Fame Academy</a>, a brief hiatus and a time in <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tlseptember">The Last September</a>  - played a solo gig at Beanscene in Leith last night. He played really well and the was some class banter ("if you were to shag an animal what type of animal would you shag?"). Check out <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ainsliehenderson">Ainslie's MySpace</a> for more gig info (including more dates in Edinburgh). Fail is a song with the same kind of sentiment as classic Suburbia songs - songs like Mother Please - but <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=roZwlc-pDfA">add a backing band into the mix</a> and it's got the same passion as Home.</p>
