<p>It's been a while since I posted - mostly due to baby Martha! - but seeing as it has been a while it seems appropriate to have use my first post back for reflection. I remember seeing the "Things I've Done"/"Jobs I've Had" hashtags trend on Twitter a while ago and it got me thinking... what things have I done that I'm proud of?</p>
<ol>
<li>Marrying Ruth :D</li>
<li>Having a beautiful baby daughter :D</li>
<li>Being a voluntary leader for <a href="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/">Borders Exploration Group</a> and the Duke of Edinburgh's Award</li>
<li>Writing my <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004AHKCWU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=giftsfcouk-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004AHKCWU">first novel</a> for National Novel Writing Month in 2009! It's not great but it was a laugh writing it - you can download my first real attempt at writing here for free as a PDF or <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004AHKCWU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=giftsfcouk-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B004AHKCWU">for <del>Â£3.73</del> 86p from Amazon for your Kindle</a>.</li>
<li>Recording an <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/ClanenCeilidhBand">EP with our ceilidh Band</a> which has already been downloaded over 400 times</li>
<li>Managing Bedlam Theatre during Edinburgh's Fringe Festival in 2003</li>
</ol>
<p>I've done lots of other things that I'm proud and these were just the first <del>5</del> 6 that came to mind but what are your top 5 (or 6!) things?</p>
