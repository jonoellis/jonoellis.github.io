<p>It's been so long since I've posted that it isn't really a blog any more. :( Anyway. A little bit of promotion - I made a site for Ruth's dad for Zigzagraphics, a new site selling <a href="http://www.zigzagraphics.co.uk/">black and white artwork for babies</a>. His art is really cool and I hope that it does well. :)</p>
