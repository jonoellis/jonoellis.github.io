<p>Well what can I say? Whilst it seems that everyone else on the planet is filling their ears with Crimbo tunes I am checking out some of the artists from this years <a href="http://www.blipfestival.org/" target=_blank>Blip festival</a>. Here are some of my faves:</p>
<p>Saskrotch - Unfinished The Hero Returns<br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/sabrepulse" target=_blank>Sabrepulse - Hey Kate</a><br />
<a href="http://bit.shifter.net/audio.php" target=_blank>Bit Shifter - March Of The Nucleotides</a><br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/thedepreciationguild" target=_blank>The Depreciation Guild - Butterfly Kisses</a> (a cool mix of chiptunes and a more conventional indie setup).<br />
Firebrand Boy - The End (Firebrand Boy also does a mean cover of Postal service - Such great heights)<br />
8GB - Lemon Prize<br />
<a href="http://www.dotmatrix.at/music/markus_schrodt" target=_blank>Markus Schrodt - Colors</a><br />
And lastly but certainly not leastly...<br />
6955 - Museum 1</p>
<p>Cool eh? 6955 also does the music for <a href="http://www.kokoromi.org/fez" target=_blank>Fez</a>; the most amazing looking yet-to-be-released video game. The reason it looks so awesome? It switches between a 2D pixelated world and a 3D one! Cool! Here's the trailer:<br />
