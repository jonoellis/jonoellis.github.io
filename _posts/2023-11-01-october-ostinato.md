Busy month way more audiobook time that music time  (Terry Pratchett's biography/autobiography - it's fab). Here are some of my musical highlights from the month:


* [i’m confident that i’m insecure - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEV3TYREgkk)

	 I wish I had a hundredth of the skill, confidence and humour that this pair of heroes are busting out right here! I'd not seen any of the other "landmark jams" so here's [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29IOMUFGrak), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBt2pJlnTHw), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwpIgL5Cg9g), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIFLs4hNtHA), [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5S5Lcels7c), [6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Xpv3oOt_M) and (this one) [7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEV3TYREgkk).


* [Pompeii MMXXIII - Bastille, Hans Zimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nfhHBJQXOY)

	 One to play on big speakers - such a massive sound. 


* [Letter To Myself  - Lottery Winners ft. Frank Turner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz3Y2O-m5-w)

	 I love the concept of this album. And always great to see where Frank Turner turns up.


* [Warming (Mvt. 5) - Erland Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JA4AFEFyQN4)

	 If "lush shoegaze piano" is a genre, count me in!


* [Play It Safe - Tim Minchin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8ouigVtUvo)

	 The Sydney Opera House - what a building, what a history, what a song to remember it by. There's nothing like a bit of a retrospective to change the views on an inauspicious start. One of the most iconic buildings in the world. And a nice tune.


* [Stop Talking (Bass and Vocals only) - Miya Folick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzUkfIQPxBA)

	 Sweet bass playing and an astounding vocal performance. Didn't know who Miya was until this popped up - thanks algorithm gods!


* [All For The Best - Thom Yorke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yassj4iJK1k)

	 Sometimes I forget that I was a massive Radiohead fan. Somehow this (cover) song by Thom passed me by. And it's glorious. 


* [Gloria - The Snuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOd58qHJeZA)

	 Scottish indie at its finest.
