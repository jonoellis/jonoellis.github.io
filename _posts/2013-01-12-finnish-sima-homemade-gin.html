<p>December was a month of drink concoctions... Disaronno &amp; Coke, Hot chocolate with manukka honey and chipotle Tabasco, <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook:Sima">Finnish Sima</a>, some gin for Ruth's Christmas and some homebrew beer flavouring. I'd definitely make Sima again - it was pretty easy and tasted amazing: for an 800ml bottleÂ boil water, dissolve 100g brown sugar, cool bottle to pitching temp, zest and juice a lemon, add 6 raisins and half a pack of bakers yeast - leave it open and out of the fridge for 48 hours then seal it and pop it in the fridge for a day or so... yum.</p>
<p>The gin was for Ruth's Christmas. Ingredients were as follows:</p>
<p>* 20cl of vodka<br />
* 3 black peppercorns<br />
* 6 juniper berries<br />
* tiny shard of licquorous root<br />
* smallest cardomon pod<br />
* small snip of vanilla<br />
* pinch of sugar<br />
* tiny snip of dried pear<br />
* orange peel in the shape of an R</p>
<p>It was too early to taste it before Christmas so hopefully the end results are positive!</p>
