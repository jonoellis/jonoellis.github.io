<p>I was inspired to try to rebrew my <a href="https://ellis.scot/2014/08/solo-beer-brew-lorem-ipasum/">Lorem IPAsum IPA</a> with a hint of the orange and some spice that has worked well for "Better than a pair of socks" and <a href="https://bagboilbeer.wordpress.com/2014/03/13/biab3-extra-special-bitter/">Kev&amp;Jono's ESB</a> and lagers.</p>
<h2>Ingredients/Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Boil hops were same as <a href="https://ellis.scot/2014/08/solo-beer-brew-lorem-ipasum/">last time</a>Â but no secondary hops</li>
<li>1,100g Pale</li>
<li>100g Golden Promise</li>
<li>100g Lager</li>
<li>Small piece of ginger (50g max) grated (full boil)</li>
<li>60 min mash, 60 min boil, no chilling (instead it went into demi overnight to cool)</li>
<li>Mangrove Jack West Coast yeast</li>
<li>Roasted orange peel in secondary for 7 days</li>
<li>3.48 litres with 20g demerara sugar for bottling</li>
<li>OG: 1.044 down to FG: 1.012 making it around 4.7%</li>
</ul>
<h2>Brewclub Tasting Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Called it an IPA, really liked the orange ness. Not getting much in the way of spice.</li>
<li>Love it, spice works well. A unique take on a Christmas beer.</li>
<li>Lots of Orange, hint of ginger, maybe needs more ginger.</li>
<li>1st impression is ginger, then something sweet, maybe dates.</li>
<li>Lovely bitter orange develops. Wish there was more left</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall I'm annoyed that I didn't put hops into secondary as originally planned but I'm really happy with the end result. I hope that people enjoy their Christmas presents (along with Kev&amp;Jono's Imperial Stout AND <a href="https://ellis.scot/2014/10/fifty-shades-of-stout-1/">my treacle chilli stout</a>!).</p>
