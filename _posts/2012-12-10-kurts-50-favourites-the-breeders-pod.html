Hmmmm - despite really liking Happiness Is A Warm Gun this album left me kind of flat. It's not the Pixies - that's for sure! I'd hoped it would be better... especially since it was recorded in Edinburgh! I'll definitely listen to it again sometime - it's a nice enough album - I think I'd just expected something heavier!</p>
