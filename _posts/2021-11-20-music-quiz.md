Just in time for the Festive season, here's a little music quiz that I've used a few times over the past couple of years - songs and their famous covers. I normally do it as 50/50 name the cover, name the original. You can probably just paste this in to a [playlist converting website](https://www.spotlistr.com/search/textbox) and magically get it in Spotify.
