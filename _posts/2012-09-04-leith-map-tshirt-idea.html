I haven't seen mappy area-name tshirts before so consider this the proof of concept! Final versions can come in Google, Bing or OpenStreetmap versions. To be fair it can also come in your choice of tshirt colour, font and border colour! Are you a proud Leither? Or, indeed, would you like one customised for a different location? Let me know - on-demand tshirt printing from <a href="http://www.streetshirts.co.uk/">StreetShirts</a> puts a vest (like the one here) at £18 including P&amp;P and a tshirt at £21. Any takers? (Jono's don't make tshirts... but if they did it may well look like this!)</p>
