My head is reeling from how busy this month has been! So many lovely moments with lovely people but - my word! -  we're at capacity. Lots and lots and lots of new music and I've also listening through Fur & Loathing podcast and Serial podcast season 4 - heavy topics told brilliantly. 


* [Whatcha Want - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0BxLxEBdKI)

	 Lawrence have three things - talent, humour, graft. Every song on this album is a banger, right from track one. Whatchat Want has so much energy, Guy I Used To Be just gets stuck in my head, Promotion has a whistle solo, i'm confident that I'm insecure and 23 have been out a while and are tremendous. Amazing album. 


* [Fall/Leave - racecar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl8-Qym13Ws)

	 There's so much packed into this song - close harmony going through some discopop, a baroque interlude and then a driving rock finale. It rocks. 


* [Smoke and Sweets - Midnight Ambulance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGdHdvspAnk)

	 Midnight Ambulance are one of those bands that each new song that I hear I love more. Sounds a bit like The Last Dinner Party and Wolf Alice. Alice is cool. Morlich has a fab vocal layers. Stained Cotton has the best harmonies. Smoke and Sweets sounds like it could have been performed two thousand years ago on a hillside. 


* [S.O.B. - Nathaniel Rateliff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iAYhQsQhSY)

	 So many great tracks from Nathaniel - I Need Never Get Old is brassy and fun, You Worry Me is late night driving, and S.O.B. is whole band are on a high.


* [Combat - Ela Minus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdQJ6P-bv-o)

	 It's hard to place the genre on this - it has Bjork-esque vocals, cinematic minimalism and lush glitchy arpegios running in the background - and it's beautfiul. (Her set from home during lockdown is [absolute mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0RklKDP2hk). 


* [Live at the Philharmonie de Paris - Nils Frahm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPPzQgTaLbo)

	 An astounding concert. 


* [Tubthumping  - They Might Be Giants & The AV Club Chorus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yf0Amcgxot8)

	 I loved hearing that the A.V. Club 25 cover songs series is coming back so it was nice to remanisce with TMBG bringing everyone together in a tiny room to smash out a fun cover of Tubthumping. 


* [HYPOCRITE - Daisy Grenade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzdDELMcs7s)

	 This band really know how to write catchy tunes. And coming out on FUELED BY RAMEN is a sign that this band will be massive!


* [Sex Scenes - Lecki Lecki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeoS6aJwRek)

	 Catchy Scottish pop-rock with summer vibes. 


* [Pata Pata AKA The Dance - Miriam Makeba
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBJVVhn7iuo)

	 This tune is the perfect soundtrack for happy moments. (And the remix from Matt Cherne is [featured on Mark Rober videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rOr8-IorVs).)


* [The Quest for Tanelorn - The Blind Guardian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvtZ9_EN0xs)

	 I didn't know a lot about this band but I do know that they rock!


* [Number One Wee Guy - Night Caller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04QdwI2Rf8c)

	 Somehow sounds like Leith and the 1950's. Fantastic sound. 


* [Pain In My Heart - Schrotthagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQuWxit0BTI)

	 Love it when the beat drops. 


* [Midway - Bad Bad Hats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOUC6m82xEc)

	 Such a gorgeous vibe - excited to find this band! So much lovely music - Bored In Summer is cool, and It Hurts has a rad kazoo solo!


* [Par hasard - Romain Muller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPlPNyTtV5g)

	 It's bliss when the synth comes in.


* [Back To The Radio - Porridge Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDw9nTQKGd4)

	 The build in tension with this song... and the grit in the vocals... are awesome. U Can Be Happy If U Want To is such a fab tune foo. 


* [Anthems For A Seventeen Year-Old Girl (Broken Social Scene Cover) - IAN SWEET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sykeDuzfvg)

	 Sounds like it sould be on a 90s movie soundtrack. Love the colab with [Porridge Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sykeDuzfvg) too. 


* [Punching Bag - The Front Bottoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUv0xw3Srro)

	 This is the most Scottish-indie a band can sound without being Scotish. 


* [Eulogy - grandson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWz6EjEYmYc)

	 Genius lyrics and a chilled beat.
