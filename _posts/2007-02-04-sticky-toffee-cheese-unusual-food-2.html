<p>Asda make Sticky Toffee Cheese. Jonos like Sticky Toffee Cheese. All you need to know is that it is cheddar cheese with dates, raisins, golden syrup (I think) and bits of toffee in it. It's kind of on a similar theme to Bowland cheese (which I guess is kind of like what I imagine Mince Pie Cheese would be like - Lancashire cheese with raisins, apple and cinnamon). I know that there have been other crazy cheeses (like chocolate cheese and Christmas cake cheese and cheese with bacon bits) but if you see this one you have to try it. It tastes so nice and caramelly and I just tried it on some toast and it went a bit melty and was yum. In other cheese news... my favorite cheese is probably still the one with Mexican chilli in it. Or maybe Wensleydale with cranberries. I want to make peanut butter cheese now. Don't know why but I think that it might work. Maybe with some chicken to make a sate-like taste? Whilst searching for more info on sticky toffee cheese I someone mentioned other unusual food and the best sounding one has to be cider ice lollies. This sounds refreshing for long hot summer days. Off for more cheese.</p>
