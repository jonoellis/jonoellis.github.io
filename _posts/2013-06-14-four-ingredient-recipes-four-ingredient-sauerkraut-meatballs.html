<p>The June Daring Cooks&rsquo; challenge sure kept us rolling - meatballs, that is! Shelley from <a href="http://cmomcook.blogspot.com/">C Mom Cook</a> and Ruth from <a href="http://mommy-crafts.blogspot.com/">The Crafts of Mommyhood</a> challenged us to try meatballs from around the world and to create our own meatball meal celebrating a culture or cuisine of our own choice.</p>
<p>I chose sauerkraut meatballs. Here&rsquo;s the ingredients list:</p>
<ul><li>Bacon (1 pack)</li>
<li>Sauerkraut (1 big jar)</li>
<li>Bread (2 slices)</li>
<li>Oats (1 handful)</li>
</ul><p>Blend the above with dill, paprika and seasoning and form into little balls. Oven bake at about 150 degrees (fan) for about 25 minutes.</p>
