The year definitely went out with a hectic bang! Some great stuff including double work Christmas nights out (so much lovely food and perfect company - I work with some awesome people), Edinburgh schools Christmas concert killing it, some volunteering at the school concert, a great trip to the Borders, hosting a jolly Christmas crew, a trip North, a blue cheese December, Stereolab... some middle stuff including the wonderful The Fifth Elephant play but it was canned 2/3rds of the way through due to an incident.. and then there was the other stuff from the trival but personal car woes to the global and horrific topics of Epstein, Ukraine, the climate, etc. Wow 2026, just wow. Music included...:


* [FLUGEL (a live album) - Andris Mattson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OC0U-wKxHk8)

	 Listen of the month - the pedals working on the brass sounds so lush! Pre-saved the album for 2nd Jan but honestly the videos showing the performance add to it.


* [A Charlie Brown Christmas: Live at The Jazz Estate
 - The Commercialists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3m3mcGnq3A&t=609s)

	 This has so much heart - a lovely thing to have been able to listen to. Made my Christmas listening. (Thanks https://kottke.org/25/12/a-charlie-brown-christmas-live)


* [THUM - Violet Grohl](https://violetgrohl.bandcamp.com/album/thum-b-w-applefish)

	 Violet has done a great thing - I'd describe it as sounding like Courtney Love singing over Dave Grohl on instruments and Butch Vig on production...


* [In the beginning, there was Trance - Switch Angel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFSwWzxrqUA)

	 The audio describing the music as the music is genius. 


* [Solar Invocation - Zé Burnay](https://zeburnay.bandcamp.com/album/solar-invocation)

	 Some experimental drone stuff to work to.


* [On The Radio - Regina Spektor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHAhnJbGy9M)

	 Heard this (unironically) on the radio for the first time in ages and it took me back to 


* [Wound Up Here (By Holdin On) - Wednesday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24si8B9C-g)

	 Strong vocals against fuzzy guitars.
