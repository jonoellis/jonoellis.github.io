<p>As it's <a href="https://ellis.scot/2018/12/2018-roundup/">a bit of a tradition</a>, here's my 2019 roundup. I'm not going to get all mushy this year - it's been a great year in spite of some pretty tough bits for most people - and I'm so humbled and thankful to family and friends for all of the good stuff that's made this year awesome. We've achieved a lot this year (and am thankful of that) - next year I'm looking forward to sharing my first kids book with the world, popping up a yurt up north, making some music and travelling to some brand new places, all in the company of the awesome Ruth and Martha!</p>



<h2>Top Books</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cory Doctorow - Radicalised</li>
<li>History of the World in 100 Objects</li>
<li>Neal Stephenson - The Diamond Age</li>
<li>Neil Gaiman - Norse Mythology</li>
<li>Matt Haig - Reasons To Stay Alive</li>
<li>Peter Burnett - How To Do Privacy In The 21st Century</li>
<li>Loki - Poverty Safari</li>
</ol>
<p>Cory Doctorow continues to be a fantastic author, writing near-future sci-fi that questions the present in a way that tells wonderfully human-centred stories.</p>






<h2>Top Films &amp; TV</h2>
<ol>
<li>Endgame & Captain Marvel</li>
<li>Stranger Things (Season 3)</li>
<li>Zombieland 2: Double Tap</li>
<li>Anna by Luc Besson</li>
<li>Atomic Blonde</li>
<li>Russian Doll 	</li>
<li>Glass</li>
<li>Bandersnatch</li>
<li>Unicorn Store</li>	
<li>Antarctica - A Year On The Ice	</li>
</ol>
<p>I've watched less low quality stuff this year so there's less chaff to choose from, but the Worst film of the year goes to Escape Plan 2 - honestly not sure why I watched it. Game of Thrones was pretty darn close to being that bad though!</p>
<p>Thanks to Kev for being my cinema buddy!</p>







<h2>Top Places</h2>
<p>Compared to last year it's been a year of more local travel... 2020 is already looking to have some interesting travel!</p>
<ol></ol>
<li>Last Christmas/New Year break to Poland brought joy that carried through much of the year - thanks R,M,C&S!</li>
<li>London social and for work - thanks D&B,D,E&M!</li>
<li>Achnasheen in a vintage camper with no proper working gears!</li>
<li>Camusdarrach - father-daughter camping! In the rain!</li>
<li>Norfolk - combining family visit with lots of CentreParcs time!</li>
<li>Durham and Elie with the two sides of the family</li>
<li>Mhor 84 - love this place!</li>
</ol>


<h2>Top Gigs</h2>
<p>I've been to fewer gigs this year than I think I've been to ever before. I missed out of a free ticket to the Pixies as I was poorly, and on two separate trips to London missed artists I'm dying to see (Jon Hopkins and Frank Turner, both performing less than 10 mins from my accommodation!) I shall do better next year!</p>
<ol>
<li>Underneath the Stars festival</li>
<li>Does Massaoke count?</li>
<li>Trinity Academy music concert and TPS Glee performance!</li>
<li>Supper Club</li>
<li>Jarvis Cocker</li>
</ol>



<h2>Top Music</h2>
<ol>
<li>Jon Hopkins - Singularity</li>
<li>Clean Cut Kid - Felt & Painwave</li>
<li>Jonnie Common - Trapped in Amber</li>
<li>Ellen Allien (no particular album)</li>

<li>CoCo and the Butterfields (no particular album)</li>
<li>Hope & Social - All Our Dancing Days (seeing this live was the greatest music moment of the year - the glory of cancelled show lightning storm in-tent mud brass band leaving the stage and joining the crowd madness)</li>
<li>Magic Sword - Volume 1</li>
</ol>
