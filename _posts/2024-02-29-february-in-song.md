So many tunes have caught my ear this month - truly we are blessed by all these great artists.


* [Prelude to Ecstasy - The Last Dinner Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFsJuYb42hw)

	 It's a little too early in the year to be talking about best album of 2024... but this is the benchmark by which all else will be judged! Gjuha in to Sinner is an astoundingly good track transition.


* [Take Me To Church (by Hozier) - Harvard Veritones A Cappella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKcWDhli56Q)

	 I'm a massive fan of acapella and the HArvard Veritones are world class. There is so much power and grit in this version.


* [Dune - Miles Kvndra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uEp4GFDdII)

	 A HUGE sound from a single synth - and it does indeed have Dune vibes. 


* [Warming - Erland Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UwOrap0YOE)

	 Ellen's poetry adds a weight that I didn't think was possible to add to this already heavy song. Beautiful. 


* [The Secret To Life - Fizz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLIGbE3H2OQ)

	 The lyric "I'm a supercharged supersonic freshly poured gin and tonic" sums up the vibe of this song and video!


* [Nothing Else Matters - Miley Cyrus (acompanied by with WATT, Elton John, Yo-Yo Ma, Robert Trujillo and Chad Smith)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqoQY9bobow)

	 This song rocks and I'd forgotten how good it was until a clip of Elton John saying how much he loved Metallica popped up in my feed.


* [Études No. 6 & 5 by Philip Glass - Timo Andres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zw0K4SlqHQ)

	 The comment says "move over Bach, here comes Philip Glass" and it's so true - these two pieces are stunning and Timo plays them blindingly well. The whole Philip Glass Études album with Jacopo Salvatori at the helm is a work of art - complexity sounding at points like something you'd need to programme a synth to play. I love Book 1 - 1, 2, 6 and Book 2 - 17, 18


* [Nuclear Kittens (ça devient chaud) - Pomplamoose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HP8La1yBDrw)

	 You might remember [the somewhat frenetic short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yelGxlB65zw)... and the finished track delivers! (With a smidge less intensity)


* [My Mind (Now) - Paris Paloma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAXXp32GOa0)

	 I know that [Labour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvU4xWsN7-A) is the big deal track, but I am also loving the choral and glitch sounds of My Mind (Now). 


* [Montagnard People - Kate Von Schleicher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k6YeQ8ZqeE)

	 Sublime... and I love the sax/brass too. 


* [Don't Go Puttin Wishes in My Head - TORRES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0N46EADaqw)

	 Collect and Are You Sleepwalking? are fab tracks but this really gets me. 


* [Primo Emosfera - Allesandro Cortini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZ3MGzyYS4I)

	 It truly saddens me that this album has fewer than 10k plays through on Spotify - the armospheres that it creates are immersive and the opening track's drone makes me feel all buzzy inside. Prima, Terza and Sesta are my tips. 


* [That Girl - Emei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPKlNGRoM7U)

	 The breaks in this song are fantastic... and the way it glitches out with saturated noise at the end is great production. 


* [Are You Awake? - Lauren Mayberry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXQFFJS94XY)

	 The piano, the loopy strings and Lauren's voice blend so nicely. Way different from the rest of the tracks from the album so far. But we need more of the glitchy synthy arp at the end - love it!


* [Vermis - MEUTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lBqEPYVX1g)

	 Can you imagine what the sound in the carpark must have been like?! Goosbumps!
