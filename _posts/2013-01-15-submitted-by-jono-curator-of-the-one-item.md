Submitted by: Jono - curator of the One Item Museum project

Item: A ceramic gargoyle head by artist Andrew Norman (my father in law)

Why should this item be in a museum: Aside from it’s beauty it’s one of a kind and it’s the largest fired-in-one-piece sculpture made by Andy.

Where and when did you get it?: This was a slightly belated wedding present - we’ve only had it in our house a couple of years and I love it!
