<p>The lovely Cher of <a href="http://crazyworldofcher.blogspot.com/">The Not So Exciting Adventures of a Dabbler</a> was our July Daring Cooks’ hostess and she asked us to create homemade yogurt in our own kitchens! No incubators needed, no expensive equipment or ingredients, just a few items and we had delicious yogurt for a fraction of the cost and a whole lot healthier than what you buy in the stores!</p>
<ul>
<li>500 mls Full cream milk</li>
<li>Starter culture of yoghurt</li>
<li>1 tbsp Granulated Sugar</li>
<li>Muesli</li>
</ul>
<p>Heat the milk to 85 degrees C then cool back down to 45 degrees C, add yogurt, sugar and muesli, stir and put into something insulated overnight (to keep the temperature up). Then you can refrigerate and eat. Job done! This tasted pretty delicious and I’ll definitely make it again.</p>
