<p>There's been so much going on lately that I haven't had much time to blog; I have created five cool makes that are worth sharing though: </p>

<img src="/uploads/marthas.jpg" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>This project was EPIC. It started as a "I've still got InDesign for a few more days after creating this <a href="https://martha.ellis.scot/things-on-sticks-cookbook/">cookbook</a> - I shall make the 'Famous Marthas' thing that I talked about!" and turned in to a three-monther. Still, there are <a href="https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2019/02/19/new-orleans-reducing-homeless-hurricane-katrina">many</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Argerich">awesome</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Reeves">and</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Washington">inspiring</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Gellhorn">Marthas</a> out there to inspire my Martha (not that she needs much inspiration to be awesome - she's so busy kicking all kinds of ass!)</figcaption>

<img src="/uploads/bun.jpg" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>These guys were yum. <a href="https://www.japancentre.com/en/recipes/809-hirata-buns">Recipe here</a> and <a href="https://www.japancentre.com/en/recipes/533-bbq-pork-chashu">BBQ chashu filling recipe here - I made mine using bacon</a> (I pickled some cucumber to go with)</figcaption>

<img src="/uploads/beer.jpg" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>Kev and I are trying to brew more often - this one is a quick IPA flavoured with Nelson Sauvin hops, the last one was a Scotch Ale with rum, raisins and some oak - I haven't tasted either yet but the pre-bottling sample was decent!</figcaption>

<img src="/uploads/bread.jpg" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>I've been doing so well at Geoffrey (our sourdough starter) alive and they have rewarded us with the nicest loaf to date!</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
<img src="/uploads/chorizo.jpg" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>So it turns out that chorizo is waaaaay more fiddly than I expected but tastes even better when you've made it yourself</figcaption>
