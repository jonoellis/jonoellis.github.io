<p>Instagram, the sometimes controversial photo sharing app/site with 100 million users, is a fantastic way to share images of your business &ndash; especially the cool not-quite day-to-day goings on in a hotel that guests love to see. The app itself is a simple tool to take filtered square photos, but some clever people have turned it into something so much more: from on-site widgets to getting posters printed here&rsquo;s our breakdown of some great uses of Instagram for hotels and restaurants.</p>
<p>&ndash; Instagram has an API (Application Programming Interface) allowing developers to make use of user-generated images on their site. Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://standardhotels.com/high-line/gallery/exterior" target="_blank">Standard Hotels</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thompsonhotels.com/inn-sight/instagram" target="_blank">Thompson Hotels</a>&nbsp;for great examples</p>
<p>&ndash; Staying in New York, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/1681777/cant-decide-what-to-order-try-this-restaurants-instagram-menu" target="_blank">Comodo restaurant</a>&nbsp;got their customers to photograph their meals and the results are certainly making me hungry</p>
<p>&ndash; The API can also be used to pull Instagrams taken at a particular location (or with a certain hashtag) so that they can be printed or put on one website &ndash; one great usage of this has resulted in the modern equivalent of a&nbsp;<a href="http://instaprint.me/" target="_blank">photobooth</a></p>
<p>&ndash; And printing doesn&rsquo;t just have to be simply getting your photos printed out &ndash; you can also get wall canvases, wooden wall prints, coasters, tiny books, fridge magnets, posters, stickers and photo cubes</p>
