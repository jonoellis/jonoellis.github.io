<p>Sometimes the version of a movie that you watch isn't quite what other people want to watch. Directors cuts have been around since the 1980's (Blade Runner being a pretty important film where director Ridley Scott had a very different idea of what should be released when compared to the original final cut). Similarly there are a few amazing amateur film editors out there who re-cut or piece together parts of films, tv shows and music videos to create their own preferred version.</p>
<p>Amateur edits of movies have probably always been out there but Baader-Meinhof phenomenon kicked in recently and I started spotting recut versions of films EVERYWHERE so I thought that I'd share some of my favourites.</p>

<p>To fans of the Harry Potter series Severus Snape is a very important character - this recut takes only Severus' story and puts his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhOQ4VW6xV8">most important scenes into chronological order</a>. It may seem whimsical but this makes Snape's story seem so much sadder than it seemed when told as only a part of the bigger saga.</p>
<p>There is an amazing cut of Pulp Fiction which has the entire film put back into chronological order - unfortunately it looks like it's been removed from YouTube but it's worth doing a bit of a google to see if it's out there somewhere. Something really interesting here is that you don't need to pay anywhere near as much attention - much of Tarantino's art as a storyteller has been removed as the interesting leaps are all gone. It feels weird to me - dumbed down without making any changes to the content, just how it's ordered - but that makes it all the more worthy of a watch. [There's also a chronological cut of the entirety of the <a href="http://www.chronologicallylost.com/">Lost tv series</a> - I've not watched it but I've heard that it totally wipes out the mystery!]</p>

<p>Star Wars VI:Return of the Jedi featured the epic space battle... but it was muddled up with the Ewok battle and also Han and Darth duelling it out - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPZigWFyK2o">this video</a> is all pew-pew, no Ewokese. If you'd asked me how long the space battle lasted in ROTJ I'd probably have said 2-3 mins, not the eight and a half that it actually has. Putting it all together totally changes my impression of the film and, in fact, puts the star wars back into Star Wars.</p>

<p>To finish off... there's Marvel. The Marvel universe is truly massive and the film series is expanding at an insane rate to try to catch up. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2bNw5Ye8Ek">This summary</a> is 13 minutes of awesome, really giving you the history of the Avengers and all the other characters. But there's something else out there - <a href="http://www.blastr.com/2014-12-26/intrepid-fan-recuts-marvel-phase-1-film-verse-chronological-order">all of the movies with all the segments recut into the correct order</a>! I love the idea of this project so much. Needless to say there's nowhere available for you to download this, you're going to have to do the epic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJFG58UKbdQ">work yourself</a>... </p>
