![A large wall mural of a fist with LOVE letter rings across the knuckles](https://ellis.scot/uploads/2025/2025-08-02-love-fist.jpg)


The station! 😍 The staircase! (Montagne de Bueren). The beer! (Lucien's blueberry and rosemary sour - Lucian seems like a wizard so it was a shame the bottles were 500s otherwise I'd have tried the rutabaga (swede!) and hazelnut sour). The meatballs! (Pork minced with breadcrumbs, onions and parsley in a sauce of onions, vinegar, brown sugar, Liège syrup (apple, pear and dates) and Corinthian raisins (currants). 😋). Spent so little time there (half a day between trains) so there wasn't a lot of looking for graffiti time but I spotted this Love rings fist and thought it summed Liège up.
