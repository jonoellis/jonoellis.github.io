For my 2013 Thing A Day challenge I'm going to try to record a cover song on my ukulele each day. I can't promise I'll manage the full month but I've managed three so that's a start! <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jono-ellis/sets/thing-a-day-2013">You can listen to my covers here</a> - let me know what you think!
