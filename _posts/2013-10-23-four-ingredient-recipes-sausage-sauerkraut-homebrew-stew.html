<p>Hi! This is Jonoâ€™s wife here. I usually blog at <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk">makey-cakey</a> and generally make things that have more than 4 ingredients, however whilst I was cooking Sunday dinner I realised two things: firstly, it tasted awesome and secondly, it only had four ingredients. It seemed only fair that I should write a guest post about it.</p>
<p>This is super easy - a slow cook that allows all the flavours to develop and it was delicious paired with some fluffy mash.</p>
<p><strong>Sausage &amp; Sauerkraut Homebrew Stew (serves 4-5)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1x 500ml bottle homebrew - in this case an IPA</li>
<li>5x pre-boiled Bratwurst sausages (ones with a high meat content so they stay firm)</li>
<li>2 medium onions</li>
<li>250g sauerkraut</li>
</ul>
<p>Halve the onions and slice thinly, and cut the sausages into thirds.</p>
<p>Brown the onions and sausages in a large casserole dish or deep frying pan over a low heat for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Add the sauerkraut and beer and continue to simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for about 3hrs.</p>
<p>Top up with a little water every now and then to stop it sticking and drying out.</p>
<p>Feel Germanic and enjoy!</p>
