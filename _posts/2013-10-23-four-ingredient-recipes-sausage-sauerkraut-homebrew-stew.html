<p><span>Hi! This is Jono’s wife here. I usually blog at </span><a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk"><span>makey-cakey</span></a><span> and generally make things that have more than 4 ingredients, however whilst I was cooking Sunday dinner I realised two things: firstly, it tasted awesome and secondly, it only had four ingredients. It seemed only fair that I should write a guest post about it.</span></p>
<p><span>This is super easy - a slow cook that allows all the flavours to develop and it was delicious paired with some fluffy mash.</span></p>
<p><strong>Sausage &amp; Sauerkraut Homebrew Stew (serves 4-5)</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>1x 500ml bottle homebrew - in this case an IPA</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>5x pre-boiled Bratwurst sausages (ones with a high meat content so they stay firm)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>2 medium onions</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>250g sauerkraut</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>Halve the onions and slice thinly, and cut the sausages into thirds.</span></p>
<p><span>Brown the onions and sausages in a large casserole dish or deep frying pan over a low heat for about 10 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>Add the sauerkraut and beer and continue to simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for about 3hrs.</span></p>
<p><span>Top up with a little water every now and then to stop it sticking and drying out.</span></p>
<p><span>Feel Germanic and enjoy!</span></p>
