<p>The LA times has a cool article all about <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-assistme30sep30,0,1261484,full.story?coll=la-home-business">hiring a personal assistant</a>. I heard about someone a few years ago who'd hired a freelance coder to do their work for them; getting someone to book you gig tickets or find you flights is a wee bit different to doing your work for you but still somehow seems a bit wrong. It's cool that it's available if you're a busy person but I don't think that I need one just yet though!</p>
