<p>I've been waiting for a while to have <a href="http://comeongang.co.uk/">Come On Gang</a> as my band of the week... but the wait is over - <a href="http://comeongang.co.uk/releases/fortune-favours-the-brave">Come On Gang's first single is out now</a>!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7hZzwlNwgw">Fortune Favours The Brave</a> is so catchy you'll be humming it at bus stops and the video is awesome too - can you name any other band with a tiger fighting a dinosaur in their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7hZzwlNwgw">first music video</a>? No, I didn't think so. <a href="http://comeongang.co.uk/releases/fortune-favours-the-brave">You can even get a free copy if you sign up to their mailing list</a>. Enjoy. :)</p>
