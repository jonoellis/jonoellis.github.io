<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/dallasgreen">City and Colour</a> are one of those bands that I can't believe I've taken so long to discover; they tick all the boxes for me with their nice chilled acoustic sounds, soaring vocals and sweet sounding harmonies. I tried to describe them but the best I could come up with was that they sound like what I'd imagine Bon Iver joining up with Frightened Rabbit to do acoustic covers of The Gaslight Anthem would sound like.</p>
