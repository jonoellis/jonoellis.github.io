<p>I wrote this post ages ago so I thought that I may as well post it so that it's done. I read some stuff on <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/" title="Lifehacker" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a> about some other peoples favourite computer setup so for no reason at all I thought that I could also share my list of software that I use regularly:</p>
<p>Firefox [Far better than IE although it does sometimes die]</p>
<ul>
<li>Adblock Plus [Fairly good at dealing with rubbish on peoples sites]</li>

<li>ColorZilla [Hover over a page to see what colours it's made of]</li>
<li>Copy Plain Text [The Ronseal of Firefox extensions]</li>
<li>Firebug [CSS &amp; HTML inspector]</li>
<li>Google Toolbar</li>
<li>Greasemonkey [Lets you do all of these exiting things]
<ul>
<li>Numbered Google Results [This is so useful when doing reports!]</li>
<li>Linkify Ting [Turns plain text with a .com etc into a link]</li>
<li>Inline Google MP3 player [Puts a Flah mp3 player where previously there was only a link]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IE View [Open links in IE]</li>
<li>Link Alert [Brings up an icon to tell you what type of link you are hovering over]</li>
<li>Linky [Lets you open multiple links]</li>
