<p>Happy Hogmanay!</p>
<p>I've made it my tradition to look back over the year come December 31st and it seems to me that this year has been seriously busy and, as a result has flown by. As well as much great music, film and tv which I've mostly enjoyed alone (all below) as a family we've had great food, great holidays (Durham, Braehead, Norfolk, Hawick, Berwick, camping and Ardnamurchan), great gigs (God Help The Girl and Penguin Cafe), great day-trips (falconry, the Highland Show, the Kelpies and the wildlife park) and so many great Martha moments (the Nativity and the Ryder Cup photoshoot to name just two!). Ruth did the Moonwalk, made cakes for Cakes For Kids and joined a choir - all great to be involved in with her. We also fitted in a fab wedding (and Stag Doo), the Book Festival, Fringe and Festival Fireworks, I went to Rome with work and I brewed approximately once every month... what a crazy year!</p>
<h2>Music - My Favourite Music From 2014</h2>
<p>Aside from the Disney Princesses playlist, Nick Cope and the Frozen soundtrack here's what I was listening to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nine Inch Nails - saw them again and listen to them loads at work</li>
<li>Foo Fighters - loving the new album and the documentary that went with it</li>
<li>Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross - Gone Girl awesomeness</li>
<li>Muse - loving the Live in Rome performance</li>
<li>Royal Blood - so much noise from a 2 piece!</li>
<li>Ленинград - some crazy Russian-ness</li>
<li>God Help The Girl - a real labour of love</li>
<li>King Creosote  - From Scotland With Love is a pretty impressive album</li>
