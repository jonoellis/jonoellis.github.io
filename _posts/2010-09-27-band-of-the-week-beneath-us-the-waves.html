<p>beneath us, the waves is a project of Warsaw-based, Scottish musician and composer, . Neil's music is a glacial snowdrift of ambient soundscapes and haunting, elegant modern-classical compositions. It sounds like Ólafur Arnalds and Jóhann Jóhannsson conspiring in secret with Jónsi &#038; Alex and Library Tapes and draws further influences from Sigur rós, Mogwai, Arvo Pärt and Fryderyk Chopin.</p>
<p>Neil Milton/<a href="http://www.myspace.com/beneathusthewaves">Beneath us, the waves</a> make some stunning ambient, ethereal, Sigur Rós-esque sounding tunes. I'm not going to tell you which ones to listen to, just hit <a href="http://www.myspace.com/beneathusthewaves">MySpace</a> and see what you find. </p>
