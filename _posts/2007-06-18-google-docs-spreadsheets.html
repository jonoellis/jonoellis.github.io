<p>This talk is about Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets and is pretty interesting. It seems to me that the introduction of Google Gears means that we should be expecting an offline version of Docs &amp; Spreadsheets sometime soon. When this happens online documents will be able to be edited in browsers even without an internet connection and Google will be one step closer to taking over the world! Seriously though - Google Docs &amp; Spreadsheets is really good tool and looks like it is going to get even better in the near future.</p>
