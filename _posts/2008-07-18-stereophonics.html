Today's song of the day post is the last one for a few weeks because I'm off with the <a href="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/">Borders Exploration Group</a> to <a href="http://www.borders-exploration-group.org.uk/expeditions/poland/">Poland</a> for the next 2 weeks. I won't have any phone, internet, television or email for the longest time ever, which is pretty cool. I thought that since I'm off travelling I should use the Long Way Round (which is basically one of the best travelling songs ever). In case you want a more upbeat Stereophonics song you should try <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUHjDJxkcSE">Dakota</a>. See you in few weeks!</p>
