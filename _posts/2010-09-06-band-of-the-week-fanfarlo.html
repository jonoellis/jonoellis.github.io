<p>My band of the week may sound a bit like Beirut (I think it might be the trumpets and the style of the lead vocals) but that doesn't stop <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fanfarlo">Fanfarlo</a>'s first album Reservoir from being any less enchanting. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsXhQfIZD2c">The Walls Are Coming Down</a> is a particularly sweet tune. Enjoy. </p>
