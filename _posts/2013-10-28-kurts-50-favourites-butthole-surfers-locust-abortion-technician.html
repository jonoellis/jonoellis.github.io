As I've listened through this list of Kurt Cobain's favourite albums I've realised that we're definitely in a different age, musically speaking, from when this list was made and some of the punk/grunge/lo-fi/home-recording sounds on some of the albums are just so different from what I'm used to listening that they are hard to hear without taking into account all of the music that has come since. Many of these albums might have been influential but I'm not sure they are classics! Take this album versus Electriclarryland - critics say this is Butthole Surfers best album but the music on Electriclarryland is far more "musical" with better song-writing (in my opinion). Anyway - not really worthy of a listen to be honest!</p>
