School show, school London trip, lots of life admin, a fun murder mystery party, lots of board games, social walks, litterpicking volunteer day, first time in Glasgow for ages (and it didn't rain), quizzing, making some music and the constant background horror of what's going on in the world. 


* [Technoslavery / Vandalism
 - BRUIT ‚â§](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOe4k1V5uCY)

	 [The Age Of Ephemerality](https://bruitofficial.bandcamp.com/album/the-age-of-ephemerality-2) is great, the live set looks like an awesome experience. 


* [Bloom Baby Bloom - Wolf Alice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kqQESf4D_o)

	 THE VOCALS!


* [Just Raw - Aloboi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkYJb21hpyA)

	 This is the type of music I'm working on making. Loving the glitchy, techno-esque drone-like synth sound. 


* [Peregrination to Scornmoor - Magic Hilt](https://magichilt.bandcamp.com/album/saga-of-the-glinting-steel)

	 I've been really enjoying Magic Hilt #dungeonsynth whilst working this month and there's something about this song that I'm particularly in love with. 


* [The Glen (Beluga Lagoon Remix) - Levi Heron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZWqjsKsUGE)

	 Smashing together a sound of my youth (the Borders... QFX, happy hardcode, all of it) with a song that featured very heavily in the kid's primary school. 


* [Born Slippy - Underworld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiMrrleH_hI)

	 Such a powerful song and layers of nostalgia on top due to being on [Now That's What I Call Music 34](https://www.nowmusicwiki.org/wiki/index.php/Now_That%27s_What_I_Call_Music!_34_(UK_series)) (one of a handful of CDs that I owned at the time) and, of course, in Trainspotting. 


* [Dead or Alive - Jono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P093AlPgPhA)

	 Do you like Queen? And Meat Loaf? And people called Jono? Then you might like this Swedish rock band that I discovered called "Jono"! ü§£


* [Streaming Woodlands - Silverstar](https://steamingwoodlands.bandcamp.com/album/silverstar)

	 More #dungeonsynth. 


* [II - Fallen Desert Colour](https://clinquantpudendum.bandcamp.com/album/ii-2)

	 Ooft - 30 minute long dark ambient power noise? That's what's needed to get me through some days!


* [Hellfest full set - Cypress Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQz4YmWeskI)

	 The DJ scratch battle with the drummer is üî• around the 32 min mark. 


* [Teenage Dirtbag (Wheatus cover) - Victoria Canal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdnwUTkpkc8)

	 Another song that's weirdly become a "standard" - such a lovely version. 


* [Easy - DJ_Dave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiQHclg_648)

	 The [live coding/composing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvsoWehBbec) skill is off the charts!


* [Slip - MEUTE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OF-xpiZlGU&list=WL&index=1&t=1282s)

	 I missed a MEUTE gig due to not wanting to be in a sweaty unventilated venue during covid.  Still sad about that. This band are always on point. 


* [The Machine - Louise Connell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSXFwhQc2XM)

	 Vangelis-y synth, Swift-y lyrics, Chvrches-y vocals. 


* [WOLF. - Kathryn Joseph (and Lomond Campbell)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLptNcnkaEY)

	 Katheryn's vocals and lyrics are mystical over Lomond's dark synth and pulsing visuals - could be dropped straight into the soundtrack for Netfix's Dark. 


* [Living On My Own - Freddie Mercury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DedaEVIbTkY)

	 Came on the radio and I was reminded how much of a banger this song is whilst being heartbreaking at the same time.


* [Gone Til November - Wyclef Jean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsU36p7sg5I)

	 I loved the Fugees The Score and found Wyclef through that. This was a track I listened to a lot as a teenager - loved the sentimentality and the strings. Just found this video and it's a total timecapsule to see. 


* [Smiths Glastonbury Set - Rick Astley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxtrbG8zN5M)

	 [Aforementioned](https://ellis.scot/2023/06/june-jazz/) greatness. 


* [Live in Floyd, Athen - Godspeed You! Black Emperor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgkyX1-8ERo)

	 RAINDROPS CAST IN LEAD! And the on/offs in PALE SPECTATOR / GREY RUBBLE. 


* [Score - Fulton Lee](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHvprGuuC_u/)

	 This song is great good. The making of it is üßÅ
