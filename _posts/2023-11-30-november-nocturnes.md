Some truly beautiful tunes to listen to this month. Enjoy!


* [Vampire Empire - Big Thief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0sHLNPL1g)

	 Such a raw track. I love the power of it. 


* [Think Of Us Kissing - Hamish Hawk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiV_W6uMX3Q)

	 A grower of an album and a voice of a Scottish Neil Hannon. 


* [TURN THIS OFF! - blink-182](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX2GKYGcdck)

	 Lyrics not safe for kids and maybe the shortest track I've listened to this year... silly but fun. 


* [Lullaby - Becky Sikas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ40pgCfnaA)

	 LOVING the autotune/autoharp effects on the album version of this. So very lush! And the live version is stunning. Goosebumps. 


* [Retreat - Mr.B The Gentleman Rhymer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56yUySF3LDU)

	 Some very wise and humorous words here on the pandemic and being introverted - and the brass section is very smooth. 


* [The Killer - Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvANWVMbt7A)

	 TENSE! Movie was about a 7 out of 10 - better than a lot of movies this year but really could have done with a counter-character. 


* [Irreversible Motion - Martha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ejWkDuGQo)

	 Love this band for their name. This track is cool, and their [live show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiGPu65NJ28) sounds sweet. 


* [There Is a Treasure - Jeffrey Martin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYZEvVg7Bpw)

	 Such a tremendously sad and poignant song. 


* [Pneuma - Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ClCaPmAA7s)

	 A monster sound with layers on layers. 


* [Trouble of Mine - Angus Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6gzko9sCdE)

	 Loving the bleepy bloopy bass. Something To Be Done is a pretty swish track too. 


* [He Earns Enough - Jenny Moore's Mystic Business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KATeGGGnrrU)

	 Described as choral-punk, which is fantastic in itself, this tune is awesome and primal and simple and complex all at once. 


* [Dinosaur - Forever Unclean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DRBrlcI6Sc)

	 An old/new skatepunk sound.


* [Bug Like An Angel - Mitski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WW7cuAm-7Y)

	 When the choir kicks in... ooh la!
