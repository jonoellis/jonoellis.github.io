<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbc7/comedy/progpages/pennydreadfuls.shtml">Listen again</a> to Thom, Humphrey, David and Miles on their BBC Radio 7 comedy show "The Penny Dreadfuls Present... The Brothers Faversham" - it's really good! [More info about the Victorian sketch comedy troop can be found at <a href="http://www.pennydreadfuls.co.uk/">the Penny Dreadfuls</a> website]</p>
