Here's what's been spinning on the decks this month:

* [The Twilight Sad - Keep Yourself Warm](https://thetwilightsad.bandcamp.com/track/keep-yourself-warm-live-2)\
	 The new band for Grant and the cover we didn't know we needed. This song gave me shivers. What a way to keep Scott's memory alive.

* [Dropkick Murphys - All You Tories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLqb535hBi0&t=173s)\
	 I'm probably obliged to give some kind of warning about this or something.   
   
* Laurie Anderson\
   Somehow I've heard so many of the songs that Laurie influenced without really listening to her works. That's been corrected this month! [Tiny Desk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABjmQCxA7UU) led me to the original video of [O Superman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vkfpi2H8tOE) - what a treat!

* [Mckenna Grace- You Ruined Nirvana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vl0htgt-elM)\
   Yet more new and exciting pop-punk. Count me in! Loving the references.

* [Dove Cameron - Boyfriend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahZB1VVpLgA)\
   A very powerful performance. Some of Dove's songs have political messages that very much need to be heard right now.

* [Cyn - I'll Still Have Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZgtCp8mtc)\
   Gorgeous track with a very emotive video.

* [Mazie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAj6xfyHIw)\
   "the rainbow cassette" into "dumb dumb" is ðŸ”¥.

* [The Big Moon - Wide Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3gnLyqUD9M)\
   The power of this track!

* [KOSMISCHER LÃ„UFER - Goldene Tage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqNouTkVCJA)\
   Honestly, this fictionalised soundscape for a romanticised moment in the past is magnificent.
   
* [St. Vincent and The Roots - Glory Box (Portishead cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pti9Jh1nwRE)\
   A cover so good some people must think this is the original!

* [Mary Spender and Josh Turner - Sultans of Swing (Dire Straits cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcVJrul4sOA)\
   Talk about good covers - ooft!

I've also been picking off some of the [Hidden Door](https://hiddendoorarts.org/contents/music/) bands - I'm still not sure which night(s) I'll go to but there are some great acts on the lineup:

-   Porridge Radio - I could listen to [7 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbKDSeh2mwc&t=223s) all day.

-   Hot 8 Brass Band - their version of [Love Will Tear Us Apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBuTK-E0gxo) is a classic in its own right!

-   Max Cooper - the venue is going to be bouncing when [Perpetual Motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcmHXo4isWQ) kicks in!

-   The Micro Band - I love [Holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMFYprAeEQs) mostly because it just sounds like some mates having a jam!

-   Goodnight Louisa - [Get Your Hands Off My Girlfriend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7lVkkn7AXY) is, as a YouTube comment put it, pop with a punch.
