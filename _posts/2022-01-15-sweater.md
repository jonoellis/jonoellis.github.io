I've had an idea for a jumper based on a combination of the NASA space suits, the NASA sweaters that appear in the film "The Martian" and the work of artist/maker Tom Sachs. It brings together the idea of a super cosy warm jumper (which I need right now for winter in Scotland!) with the near-future sci-fi clothing that seems to pop up in so many of the films and shows that I watch. Others have done something similar before - this [white jacket](https://giv-studios.com/products/club-giv-spacely-utility-hooded-jacket-v2?variant=31853663649865) is pretty fine but I'm guessing it was a copy of this more awesome [Betabrand](https://hiconsumption.com/nasa-inspired-space-jacket-by-betabrand/) one which is very much on point with the look that I like. For my jumper the outer would be made of Tyvek - it's a strong, waterproof and futuristic fabric that is commercially used for chemical hazmat suits but also is used for papery light jackets by a few brands including Adidas (and, bizarrely, [Camel cigarettes](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/393777709323?hash=item5baefb010b:g:KtQAAOSw6qZhr9FG) for a giveaway raincoat for those outdoor smokes in the 90s!). You can read more about [Tyvek clothing here](https://www.fourrabbit.com/goingson/2020/5/15/tsunami-jacket-how-a-tyvek-jacket-was-made). The inside layer would be super warm (but not too thick, to keep that sweater feel) and would be made of Primaloft (not down - I'm allergic). Tom Sachs is a stunning artist - his [Space Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dr_F2Aho2Y) (which [Laura Kampf is about to command](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGK3WZ-mmK8)) is a fascinating work, and some of the outputs such as the [shorts and poncho are amazing](https://news.nike.com/news/tom-sachs-nikecraft-poncho-apparel). This sweater would draw on Tom's idea of functional yet futuristic NASA attire. So... does anyone have time to make me one?
