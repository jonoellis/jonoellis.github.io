Well I'm one wisdom tooth lighter than last month so that more or less sums up how I've been feeling this month! Mixed in with dental woes there have been some great times on holiday and at the Zip Trek in Aviemore, seeing friends, seeing Since Yesterday: The Untold Story of Scotland's Girl Bands, having games nights, helping family. And some great music as always. 


* [Something In The Air - Lauren Mayberry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qxVv0H2v5M)

	 The album sounds like it's going to be a real mix of styles and I'm loving it! And it finally has a release date. Not sure what's all been going on this year but so glad that it will see the light. 


* [New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down - Miles Davis x LCD Soundsystem (with a helping hand from Alessandro Grespan)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huEtJw7pfLk)

	 I didn't know about this remix. But I've heard it and cannot unhear. Now, forever, this version will be the only version of New York, I Love You. Alessandro Grespan created perfection. 


* [As Heard On Radio Soulwax (Part 2) - 2 Many DJ's](https://soundcloud.com/treisiunsfert/2-many-djs-as-heard-on-radio)

	 Throwback to 2003 - absolutely loved this CD. So glad the official recording has the  mind-blowing hidden track - you could only get to hear Kylie by rewinding for 4 minutes and 17 seconds then letting the album restart.


* [In the Grey - Low Tide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG46MDR_eQ8)

	 Edinburgh for the win - with a fair wind and more of their hard work these young folks should be huge.


* [Polaroids - Willow McKenna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-G0k_MqVv4)

	 This may be an artificial dump it still has a great hook whenever I hear it on a YouTube video. 


* [Such Great Heights - MILCK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReFgkT7Dn8E)

	 One of two good things to come from the Uglies film. 


* [Warriors - Lin-Manuel Miranda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6chSTQwxw8)

	 A concept album, not yet a show (although I can guarantee that someone will attempt to stage this within the year). Really liked the storytelling and the duet between Julia Harriman and Jasmine Cephas Jones (A Light Or Somethin') was one of the highlights.


* [When the Night Feels My Song (feat. Frank Turner) - Bedouin Soundclash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZbqxpMt5cw)

	 Another throwback!


* [I Do The Rock - Tim Curry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXPCsaO_55o)

	 What a showman. I did not know that he was friends with Freddie Mercury, nor that he designed Freddie's garden - thank you Wikipedia. Would have loved to see either or both of them perform. This song randomly came up on Radio Revolt Trondheim and what a nice surprise.


* [Rose Bay - Ludovico Einaudi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKzDeyvuKbg)

	 The forthcoming album is supposed to be reminiscent of "endless summers" and this track definitely has a summer's day sound to it.


* [Couple of Fruits - Big Fella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucfk0m8D3D8)

	 I've had a look and can't find more about this track - I'm convinced there's more to it than just a track made for the soundtrack. Great film too. 


* [Heads Roll Off - Lowswimmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubwHXXzfXAo)

	 Got the vibe right. It's still a bit tough to listen to any FR tbh, originals or covers.


* [Crisis - Izzy S.O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EijihmRZ-o)

	 Always a fan of some new pop-punk!


* [All In My Head - The Linda Lindas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy7XQPOQOvM)

	 The chorus is anthemic!


* [Forever Held - Jon Hopkins and Ã“lafur Arnalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmxfn9V3lzE)

	 Does what it was supposed to - makes you feel like you're in space (for a moon art project by NASA).
