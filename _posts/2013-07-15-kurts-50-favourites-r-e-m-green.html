I used to love R.E.M. and played Automatic For The People to death. Although this wasn't one of the albums I listened to until it wore out, it was one that I'd liked growing up. I hadn't realised that there was a personal relationship between Stipe and Cobain - it's always cool to hear that bands know eachother! Overall a decent album, not their best but still a great listen. </p>
