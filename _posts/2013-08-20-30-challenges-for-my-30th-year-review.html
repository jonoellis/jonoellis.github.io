<p>A year ago I decided to set myself 30 challenges to achieve before I reached the age of 30. That's today - lets see how I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn how to juggle - an actual juggler from a circus said that I could juggle so this one is definitely in the bag ✓</li>
<li>Run in a 10k road race - I ran the Edinburgh 10k in 56 minutes ✓</li>
<li>Run the 5km Deerstalker - Team "Run like you stole something" did a great job with me on this one ✓</li>
<li>Climb <a href="http://ellis.scot/2013/03/edinburghs-7-hills/">Edinburgh’s 7 hills</a> - done ✓</li>
<li>Watch extended versions of the Lord of the Rings films - this was a slog! ✓</li>
<li>Read The Iliad by Homer - this was even more of a slog! ✓</li>
<li>Perform at the Fringe - I cheated on this... I performed at the top of Arthur's Seat in the middle of August though, so that counts right? ✓</li>
<li>Go 1 month without chocolate, sweets or cake - did it, would rather not do it again! ✓</li>
<li>Learn greetings in 30 languages - привет! ✓</li>
<li>Raise £500 for charity - £632.50 - this was by far my biggest success and I'm really grateful to everyone who donated ✓</li>
<li>Write a novel - still needs some work but that's a yes ✓</li>
<li>Solve a Rubix cube - after a month of trying I needed a tutorial but I did it ✓</li>
<li>Write 5 short stories - a collection of five short stories <a href="http://ellis.scot/2012/11/national-short-story-week-2012/">The Freaks</a> - done ✓</li>
<li>Submit something I've written to a writing competition - I did enter, I didn't win ✓</li>
<li><del>Sing at a karaoke bar </del>Organising people for karaoke was tough... but I did something more exciting over the course of the year - Kev and I <a href="http://ellis.scot/2013/04/leith-pale-ale/">brewed our own beer</a>! I think from a list of 30 I'm allowed 1 substitution (especially since beer brewing was on my original list) and the results are delicious so I'm calling this one done ✓</li>
<li>Visit Edinburgh Castle - loved the view, shame it's so buggy inaccessible! ✓</li>
<li>Give blood 3 times - did, three more pints given ✓</li>
<li>Improve my conversational French - I can now ask if things have dairy in them in French... ✓</li>
<li>Create a video blog - despite no effort <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jonoellis1883">my YouTube channel </a>has almost had 1000 views (although I admit that a chunk of these are from uploading our school production of Little Shop of Horrors from an old VHS)! ✓</li>
<li>Set up my "<a href="http://ellis.scot/category/one-item-museum/">One Item Museum</a>" website - I love the idea of this website so much :) ✓</li>
<li>Carve something wooden - <a href="http://ellis.scot/2012/12/thirty-challenges-carve-something/">world's most useless spoo</a>n! ✓</li>
<li>Make some cheese - this was surprisingly tasty! ✓</li>
<li>Design my Christmas board game idea - <a href="http://ellis.scot/2012/12/christmas-cluedo/">proud of this one</a> ✓</li>
<li>Design own Christmas cards - I cheated and combined this with the board game... but it was well worth it! ✓</li>
<li>Record 10 ukulele covers - <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jono-ellis">some of them turned out ok</a> considering I was recording them on my kitchen floor on an iPad with no external mics!  ✓</li>
<li>Try foods from 30 countries - I wasn't too diligent about recording this, but a box of 20+ sweets from CyberCandy along with the monthly meals from different countries has been a tasty experience ✓</li>
<li>Host a dinner party on top of Arthur’s Seat - there were compromises due to weather but this was awesome ✓</li>
<li>Create own flavoured vodka - <a href="http://ellis.scot/2012/10/30-challenges-reeses-peanut-butter-cup-vodka/">Peanut Butter Cup vodka</a>! ✓</li>
<li>Spend a random weeknight under canvas - in a bivvy no less (it was surprisingly warm and awesome waking up to the stars during the night) ✓</li>
<li>Walk at least 2 days (and hopefully all of) the West Highland Way - challenging but awesome at the same time - so glad David and Matt could join me ✓</li>
</ol>
<p>To finish I just want to thank Ruth and everyone else that put up with my silly schemes all year.  Thank you. :)</p>
