<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/thearcadiankicks">Walk Alone by The Arcadian Kicks</a> is my must listen track this week. I'm probably just jumping on the bandwagon with these guys (seeing as they have Blondie's producer in tow and they're probably going to get a lot of press sometime soon) but they are actually quite good. Enjoy. </p>
