With Martha being mildly obsessed with The Octonauts at the moment I thought I could use some of my web design skills to create her a basic iPad app to play around with. It's pretty simple - push a button on the screen and it plays a sound effect from The Octonauts. It's all very unofficial - the BBC definitely didn't give me permission (hence not linking to it here! - but it's just for Martha's personal use so hopefully that's ok! The sound was ripped using Audacity, the player itself is made using the HTML5 audio tag with a little JavaScript to simplify the interface. All in all it's pretty basic but hopefully she enjoys playing with it. :)</p>
