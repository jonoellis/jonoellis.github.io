<p>I wrote a novel for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a> in 2009 and, after skipping 2010, I thought I'd give it another go this year. We're almost at the half way point (I can't believe how quickly November is disappearing) and I've written 21,860 words so far... <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_FCmUiDvVXupiwA3JKDxs1CLWi0NtPuLeioSQZa5WWA/edit" target="_blank">so here it is</a>!</p>
