<p>My own webstite has seen a few evolutions over the years - the current evolution is based on the Metro theme from the Windows 7 Phone... right down to the clock in the top right! It was a fun design to play around with, especicially to make big touchable buttons - hopefully it makes all of my main contact details easy to access!<br />
Fun fact: 51773 is my surname "Ellis" spelled out in calculater writing.</p>
