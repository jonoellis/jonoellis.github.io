<p><a href="http://petitinvention.wordpress.com/">Petitinvention</a> is a great blog with many ace designs and ideas. Yesterday they had a Mac/Gmail integration idea which looks smart and would really help user interaction; <a href="http://petitinvention.wordpress.com/2008/01/27/customize-gmail-icon-in-menu-bar/">customizable Gmail icons for the Mac menu bar</a> which would notify of emails from a specified contact. I think that this should already be possible - all it needs is some programming effort!</p>
