<p>Happy Hogmanay!<br />
It's become a bit of a tradition for me to round off the year with a post reminding myself of some of the good things in the year. Having a toddler makes life mega busy and we've some had some great days and holidays this year, including our roadtrip to France, a holiday with friends and various other little weekends away. The year has involved a birth, a wedding and lots of birthday parties - all very exciting in different ways. Blogging-wise I listened to every album on Kurt Cobain's top 50 - an achievement of endurance I feel. I completed my 30 challenges before my 30th birthday - great fun. We've started a little Tuesday film club and we've watched some great films so far. I've also done quite a bit of brewing, learning loads in the process - I just need to drink them more quickly!</p>
<h2>Music - My Favourite Music From 2013</h2>
<p>My top 3 last year were Trent Reznor, Chvrches and Frightened Rabbit... and Last FM tells me that nothing has changed this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nine Inch Nails - Hesitation Marks: Awesome album #1 (I've also continued to listen to Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Ghosts I-IV and Year Zero... and am seeing NIN live again next year)</li>
<li>Frightened Rabbit - Pedestrian Verse: Awesome album #2 (I've intentionally not listened to it too much so I don't spoil it!)</li>
<li>Chvrches - The Bones Of What You Believe: Awesome album #3 (everything I'd hoped for and more)</li>
<li>Dum Dum Girls - End Of Daze: I don't know why I love this EP so much but I really really really do!</li>
<li>SONOIO - RED: old music recently discovered</li>
<li>Vampire Weekend - Modern Vampires of the City: a really good album that easily blasts their older stuff out of the water... instant classic!</li>
<li><a href="http://ohpioneer.com/tagged/mixtape">The "Oh, Pioneer!" mixtapes</a> - well worthy of a listen</li>
