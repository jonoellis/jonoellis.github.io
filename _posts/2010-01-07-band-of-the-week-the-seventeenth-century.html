<p>The Seventeenth Century have been described as "A Hebridian take on The Beach Boys" by tThe Daily Record and “...a band that writes illustrious music whilst their admirable naivety shines through” by The Scotsman. Definitely one to watch for 2010! Check out "Roses In The Park" their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theseventeenthcentury" target="_blank">MySpace</a> for more info.</p>
