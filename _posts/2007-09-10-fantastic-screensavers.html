<p>Do it now... go to <a href="http://www.9031.com/downloads/screensavers.html">9021.com</a> and download the Flip-style "Pata Pata" Clock screensaver [Mac/Windows]. Simple and very sexy.</p>
<p>When I get my <a href="http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/ukstore.woa/wa/RSLID?nnmm=browse&#038;mco=2F15A1DE&#038;node=home/macbook/macbook">Mac</a> (as soon as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5">new OS comes out</a>!) it's also going to have to have the <a href="http://uneasysilence.com/toast/">retro Flying Toasters screensaver</a> [<a href="http://uneasysilence.com/toast/toasterclone_10.dmg">Mac</a>/<a href="http://uneasysilence.com/toast/FlyingToasterPC.zip">Windows</a>] too. (This should definitely be available for the iPhone too!)</p>
