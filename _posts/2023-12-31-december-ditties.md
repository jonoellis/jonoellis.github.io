Rounding off an awesome year of new music! (Albeit with a very quiet month)


* [Cabaret - Rebecca Taylor & The Company & Orchestra of Cabaret](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m001sw1z)

	 BBC Radio 2 hosts the current iteration of the London West End show Cabaret - Rebecca Lucy Taylor (aka Self Esteem) sounds astounding playing Sally Bowles. What a voice!


* [22,AM Outtakes and Sketches - Bon Iver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA5F1GdWDQ0)

	 As far as I can read about this, it's leaked not faked. It certainly sounds legit. And a couple of the tracks are worthy of release. 


* [Paper Crown - Marika Hackman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhGyx1FO6ho)

	 Soulful singing and gorgeous jangle on the guitars. 


* [Driving Home for Halloween - Spector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDi-NQXnhCw)

	 Something about this makes me think it could have been on the album along with Mr Brightside.


* [Scratch Your Metal - Divorce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p65H8pjPbYc)

	 Gutted that I missed a chance to see them live (they [sound amazing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcpBrZnfpP8)). Massive fan of [Checking Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-3bRTP1GpA) as well. 


* [THIS HERE AIN'T WATER - BIG SPECIAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IVjMRCH-Ks)

	 Some new punk with a duo with a focus on drums and vocals - strong sound.
