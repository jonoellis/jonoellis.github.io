For Ruth.
I drew the hearts font by hand (can I call it a font when it's only 4 letters?!) then photographed it, imported it into the computer, grabbed the pen, darkened the black, coloured the hearts, added a lighter border, made the layers semi-transparent, added a close up photo that I took of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacLellan%27s_Castle">MacLellan's Castle</a>, shrunk it down and rounded the corners.
