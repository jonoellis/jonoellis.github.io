<p>Our lovely Monkey Queen of Don’t Make Me Call My Flying Monkeys, was our May Daring Cooks’ hostess and she challenged us to dive into the world of <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/">en Croute</a>! We were encouraged to make Beef Wellington, Stuffed Mushroom en Croute and to bring our kids into the challenge by encouraging them to create their own en Croute recipes!</p>
<p>“Mandatory Items: Wrap whatever suits your taste in some type of pastry and bake it.” - that sounded perfect to me… but how to make it interesting? Pate En Croute is a common recipe, as is Beef Wellington but as far as I could see no one had ever made Squirrel En Croute - four ingredients or more!</p>
<p>A quick shopping trip for a squirrel from <a href="http://www.ridleysfishandgame.co.uk/">Ridley’s Fish &amp; Game</a> at the Stockbridge Market and I was sorted. My ingredients were:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 squirrel</li>
<li>1 pack of pate</li>
<li>1 pack of puff pastry</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
</ul>
<p>I braised and then simmered the squirrel before taking the meat off the bone. I rolled the pastry, layered on the pate and the squirrel meat and then brushed egg around the pastry. It took ages to cook but that’s because <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/">my wife</a> informed me that I shouldn’t have used a whole pack of pastry, who knew! The end result was very tasty - the squirrel meat was moister than I expected and it all tasted pretty awesome!</p>
