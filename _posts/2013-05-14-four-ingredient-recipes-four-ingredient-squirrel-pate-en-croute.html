<p>Our lovely Monkey Queen of Don’t Make Me Call My Flying Monkeys, was our May Daring Cooks’ hostess and she challenged us to dive into the world of <a href="http://thedaringkitchen.com/">en Croute</a>! We were encouraged to make Beef Wellington, Stuffed Mushroom en Croute and to bring our kids into the challenge by encouraging them to create their own en Croute recipes!</p>
<p><span>&ldquo;Mandatory Items: Wrap whatever suits your taste in some type of pastry and bake it.&rdquo; - that sounded perfect to me&hellip; but how to make it interesting? Pate En Croute is a common recipe, as is Beef Wellington but as far as I could see no one had ever made Squirrel En Croute - four ingredients or more!</span></p>
<p>A quick shopping trip for a squirrel from <a href="http://www.ridleysfishandgame.co.uk/">Ridley&rsquo;s Fish &amp; Game</a> at the Stockbridge Market and I was sorted. My ingredients were:</p>
<ul><li>1 squirrel</li>
<li>1 pack of pate</li>
<li>1 pack of puff pastry</li>
<li>1 egg </li>
</ul><p>I braised and then simmered the squirrel before taking the meat off the bone. I rolled the pastry, layered on the pate and the squirrel meat and then brushed egg around the pastry. It took ages to cook but that&rsquo;s because <a href="http://makey-cakey.blogspot.co.uk/">my wife</a> informed me that I shouldn&rsquo;t have used a whole pack of pastry, who knew! The end result was very tasty - the squirrel meat was moister than I expected and it all tasted pretty awesome!</p>
