Cramming in 4 fifteen minute shows an hour are Paul Zenon, Captain Frodo, The Space Cowboy, Koko Lush and friends, swapping about with three performers per show. It seems that you never know quite what you're going to get! The tiny tent brings you intimately close to the action and I was lucky enough to be in the front row (which consisted of 4 seats out of the 25 in the tent) and so got to be a part of Paul Zennon's magic show. The magic was "simple" but fun and as soon as Mr. Zennon was done the show moved on to Captain Frodo (putting rubber bands over his face in a pretty grotesque way) and then on to Koko Lush (who squeezed herself through some hoops and then - the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance - folded herself into a perspex box). The "roguesâ€™ gallery of freaks, geeks and neâ€™er-do-wells" was indeed "a shot of absinthe compared to the yard of ale of most Fringe shows" and was a really good laugh for Â£3. As you'd expect from a venue boasting nipple tassels as <a href="http://www.spiegeltent.net/index.php?sectionID=4633&#038;pageID=7985">merchandise</a>!</p>
