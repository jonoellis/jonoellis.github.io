<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/meursaulta701">Meursault</a> are one of those bands that seem to be on every second gig poster in Edinburgh - and are clearly working really hard - but they've taken a long time to start getting real coverage... but with a slot at T in the Park I think this might be their year. I've heard them play live twice but their sound has definitely evolved over the past few years. A Fair Exchange (and the video that accompanies it) are stunning. Enjoy. </p>
