* [I Dumped You First - Olly Alexander/God Help The Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iVsKvbUhHg)

	 Rewatched God Help The Girl to check how appropriate it was for the kid to watch... and found this gem at the end of the film. Totally forgotten about it but seems apt given that Olly is the Eurovision entry for the UK this year (and is fab in the film). 


* [Apocalypse - Cigarettes After Sex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mnH9-SX2Tg)

	 Putting the dreaminess in dreampop, getting to the core of slowcore... whatever. â€œYour lips, my lips, apocalypse". What a line. The symplicaty of this song. And the first song I've found in ages that's over a billion streams with no other notable songs from the band. 


* [1/2 Cappuccino (Chorversion) - Kapa Tult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrBdty4TFwk)

	 Such lovely energy - and love the adition of the spoken verse guest. Sorry I'm not so good at German!


* [Guy I Used To Be - Lawrence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC6-jxkMa8I)

	 Lawrence really know how to put out the hits!


* [El Principo de algo - La La Love You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH9jnG1Ylwc)

	 Love the disco beat on this pop-punk track - feels anthemic. 


* [hide n seek - Ethan Bortnick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3JbmZ7VH1E)

	 [Engravings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xWVhAOd-6U) is a monster of a track and hide n seek doesn't hold back either. 


* [Right Back To It - Waxahatchee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL3iHhERWJw)

	 The harmonies really make this song. I also love the way that the banjo sounds a bit like an arpeggiator running in the background.


* [from the fire - Virens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU6yW_vfxAA)

	 "Does it really have to be SO FUCKING HARD?" I don't know but when the harmony kicks in at that moment they hit it pretty hard. Also love stitch me back up. And by golly their cover of [Killing Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxR-fmx0_n0)!


* [Baltimore Gas & Electric Co. - Raymond Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEmJvAAT44g)

	 I'd only heard passing mention of Raymond Scott in a synth video ages ago but the [Piano Player](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7zT0hPKcBqN1ol9gdiD4rv?si=2b5bfbc019e94364) episode on 99% Invisible was a fascinating deep-dive. Very questionable human being but revolutionary in his music invention. 


* [Frog - Simon The Magpie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoDgqiXdakA)

	 Meow Meow, Nine Lives, and Broken Laughs are all fab grunge-synth-glitch-pop


* [The Catalyst - Phillp Jon Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RwiZjjszSY)

	 Love the song, the video is nauseating! 


* [Chiptune Ride - LukHash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilBRvKdIyJA)

	 Moving seamlessly from the THX deep note into Knight Rider synth then going a bit Ryanosaurus. 


* [Fake Plastic Trees (Radiohead cover) - Phoebe Bridgers x Arlo Parks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKPaA3p3bJU)

	 Phoebe Bridgers has so many collaborations I keep randomly finding new ones - and what a glorious version to find.
