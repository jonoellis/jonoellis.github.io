<p>I've never been a massive Iggy fan but I have to say that this album surprised me - I'd never listened to it before and the sound is really raw, powerful and surprisingly well written. Mixed by Bowie, released in 1973 and now seen as a fore-runner to the punk movement it's easy to see why Kurt Cobain saw this as a favourite. Overall it's well worth a listen. </p>
