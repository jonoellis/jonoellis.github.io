<p>I saw the "Welcome to Leith - twinned with Rio de Janeiro" sign from the bus the other day and although I hadn't spotted it before I thought, for some strange reason, that it might just be true. Turns out it wasn't - or at least not yet! This month The Leither tells of an advertising joke for the Leith Festival that has turned into a possible reality now that the mayors of Leith and Rio are in talks to initiate the twinning process which will even see Scotland's second drink being distributed on Copacabana beach. I know that Bru is also liked in some parts of Russia but this got me thinking: I wonder... have any cosmonauts taken it into space?</p>
