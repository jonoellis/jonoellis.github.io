<p>Seems like an age since I last wrote a blog post - it's been a busy year! I thought that it was about time for me to round up the music that I've been listening to in 2009, the final year of the Aughts. Maybe my resolution for next year should be to blog more!</p>
<p>So, without further ado, here is my list of the top music from 2009:</p>
<ol>
<li>Frightened Rabbit - even though "The Midnight Organ Fight" was a 2008 album it hasn't left my headphones all year. I can't wait for "The Winter Of Mixed Drinks" to come out next year. The gig in the Queens Hall was one of the most memorable gigs. Ever.</li>
<li>Them Crooked Vultures - It would have been almost impossible for these guys not to have written a fantastic album but the real surprise for me was just how fun seeing them live was. I'm really looking forward to seeing if these guys take this further.</li>
<li>Mumford &amp; Sons - I'm a bit gutted that I didn't hear about this band sooner but Mumford &amp; Sons sound sooooo sweet! Really worth a listen. Check them out now. Go. Stop reading this post. Go now!</li>
<li>Jónsi &amp; Alex - Sigur Rós are one of my all time favourite bands and "Riceboy Sleeps", the album from Jónsi's  side project, is well worth a listen.</li>
<li>We Were Promised Jetpacks - "Quiet Little Voices" is sure to be a song that I'll be putting on playlists for years to come. Great début album.</li>
<li>She &amp; Him - another 2010 album to watch out for is "Volume Two", the creatively named follow up to last year's "Volume One". Chilled out and quirky it's sure to be a hit.</li>
<li>Scarlett Johansson and Pete Yorn - Not to be outdone by Zooey Deschanel as an actress that's also in a band, Scarlette Johansson's album is really chilled and is surprisingly listenable.</li>
<li>Weezer - the year started off listening to "Weezer" (June 2008) and flowed seamlessly into "Raditude" (which came out in November). Great to see 2 great albums come out in such quick succession.</li>
<li>Biffy Clyro - "The Captain", the first single from the album of the same, is so very good.</li>
<li>The Twilight Sad - Although I can't listen to too much Twilight Sad in one "Forget the Night Ahead" is a brilliant album, worthy of being on any of 2009's top ten lists.</li>
</ol>
