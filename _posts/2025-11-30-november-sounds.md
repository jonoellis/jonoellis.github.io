A Halloween party where I showed off the halloween suit, a couple more Arkham nights (The Circle Undone), stunning Kae Tempest gig, a long weekend logshed rebuild at my parents house, PiePlayPintTERROR, hilarious Teacher Taskmaster night, delicious dinner out at Mara's Picklery, the most in-person days in the office in a month since Feb 2020, a somewhat dry conference, and a family trip to watch the Muppet Christmas Carol with a live orchestra. Phew - what a month!


* [Know Yourself - Kae Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5zR8YJm1B4)

	 What a gig. An emotional rollercoaster that smushed techno, hip-hop and poetry into one of the best gigs I've ever been to. (And I hate Edinburgh Corn Exchange so that's saying something). The storytelling was so powerful and building up to a retake on [Freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eos0PiYZpI0) capped it off so well. Such a great crowd. 


* [Throw Yourself To The Sword - Die Spitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBuwjdY9GRI)

	 Introduced via KEXP then found the chaos energy at [this gig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E76OI1yNY5M). So much energy.


* [Dodger - clipping.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0-k7vW9Xek)

	 Came for Daveed Diggs' 38 words in 7 seconds, stayed for the robot percussion orchestra! Nothing Is Safe. 


* [Diamonds Are Forever - David McAlmont and David Arnold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sKAtyzwM_0)

	 David McAlmont hasn't only done [one of the greatest Jools Holland shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBV_IEa7mXE), he's also done a Shirley song better than Shirley. The Shaken And Stirred album is magnificent. Could The Propellerheads' On Her Majesty's Secret Service be the definitive version?


* [This Is Hardcore - Pulp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_KlY-AegeE)

	 One of the best versions I've heard of this song ever. Glorious. 


* [Túndra - Gabríel Ólafs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GZtyLp9L8k)

	 Atmospheric.


* [ARD Mediathek - Kapa Tult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2PNvp449uA)

	 I'm not a German speaker beyond some basics but love the energy of this band.
