<p>Passwords and security&hellip; yawn! But when big, reputable sites like LinkedIn, Last.FM and eHarmony are hacked it&rsquo;s time to take note and improve your password choices.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 1</em></strong></p>
<p>Try to create long and complicated passwords.</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 2</em></strong></p>
<p>Have a unique password for each and every site that you use. When passwords are stolen from sites like LinkedIn they are (normally) encrypted and will likely contain a list of usernames and passwords for several thousand users. Decrypting passwords isn&rsquo;t easy but taking a guess at what a popular password might be (e.g. &ldquo;123456&rdquo;) and encrypting that guess allows a hacker to easily compare the encrypted value to passwords stored in the database. Suddenly it&rsquo;s very easy to see how many of the thousands of users have used 123456 as their password.</p>
<p>Your goal when you are picking passwords is to not be an easy target &ndash; hackers will grab the email addresses of silly folks with the most common passwords and try those email and password combos on other websites; if you have used that same password and email address combination on Facebook, Amazon, Ebay and Google then you could be in big trouble.</p>
