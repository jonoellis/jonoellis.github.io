Since I was away from normalilty for most of the month I've not listened to nearly as much new stuff. Still - some great new stuff.


* [Nuclear Kittens - Pomplamoose](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yelGxlB65zw)

	 It's a good sign of an upcoming album if a YouTube Short snippet of the recording process is the single best song you've heard all month! LOVE THIS!


* [Liability - Lorde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86s_1hpX4Yc)

	 I heard this song on a show and immediatly though that it sounded like a Jack Antonoff production. Lo and behold, there he is on the piano. It's an amazing track. The [live version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gjZIjVVgEc) has so much joy in it, compared to the rawness of the SNL take. (Both are outstanding)


* [Glastonbury Set 2023 - Queens Of The Stone Age](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p0ft9z2w/glastonbury-queens-of-the-stone-age)

	 The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret was an absolutely perfect performance. Marshalling a crowd that size for No One Knows was funny. 


* [High In Brighton - FIZZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3FknFHUmBs)

	 Chaotic fun with great harmonies and a lot of energy.


* [Point of Disgust - Low](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvaqUYqrghk)

	 I've just found out about the passing of Mimi Parker. Love this song so much. 


* [Takes So Much - Waxahatchee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FNCBRv-xp0)

	 Another "slowcore" track - lovely. 


* [Step By Step - EUT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP1R_XLXIkY)

	 A band that I spotted on a list of bands playing in the Netherlands - a great discovery. Sounds very 90s.


* [The Trench Coat Museum - Yard Act](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P0YpeMPZ9g)

	 I hadn't head this band before and they have a total Cake vibe and I love it!


* [Tiny Desk Concert - Cypress Hill
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUApO77uUUk)

	 An awesome set. The horn section sounds so slick!
