* [Muscle Memory - her.picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKcUrAInhzI)

	 Soundtrack to the end of the world. 


* [Never You - pedalo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNSCKSm6o_c)

	 Beautiful new sounds from Glasgow - hoping to hear them live this year. 


* [The Love It Took To Leave You - Colin Stetson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sufy9cT3x1E)

	 Singing through the saxophone and playing unbelievable repetitions. Genius.


* [Sitzprobe - Bat Out Of Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4k8g2RMkuc)

	 Even having done theatre stuff I didn't know the word "Sitzprobe"... but I'm here for them!


* [Anywhere But Here - Panda Bear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGzsWGhAmYQ)

	 A little Beach Boys, a little Vampire Weekend. The bass slide, vocals and spoken word on Anywhere But Here make for a very lovely sound. [Praise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhNGN4SnRZM) is very cool too. 


* [I Can Make You A Man - The Polyphonic Spree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWii-KwGX0Q)

	 The theatrics of this album are on point!


* [Just Wanna Be Your Friend - Puck & Natty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KveO_wFH6Q)

	 I've heard this before - I suspect that I first heard it through getting it off someone's shared drive from Edinburgh ResNet.


* [Delores - Solareye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwaul_Vu0yw)

	 Ooft. Gorgeous vocals and awesome rhymes. 


* [Easy Feelings - The Joshua Hotel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rE5dAZVM8k)

	 Sounds summery and nostalgic, Shanine's vocals especially help this song soar.
