<p><a href="http://brightsideband.wordpress.com/">Brightside</a> are a 5-piece band from Edinburgh with some pretty catchy tunes and an EP coming out soon... follow their chat on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Brightside/134670415425?v=wall">Facebook</a>. My favourite tune is "The Girl With The Red Lipstick" [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkMKckOUqLY">Video</a>/<a href="http://www.myspace.com/itsbrightside">MySpace</a>]. </p>
