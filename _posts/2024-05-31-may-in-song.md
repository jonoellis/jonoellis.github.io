A month filled with fun and absolute chaotic upheaval. And some amazing tunes. 


* [Greatness Waitress - Fishboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDnYyzjmtr0)

	 Oh wow oh wow. [The Waitsgiving album is a thing of perfection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJkfi4H_QcM&list=PL0-1l9PS0MrOEh4zB4hXKn2RXcPjsNyQu) - I'd love to see Fishboy live! (Please come to the UK!) Album of my year so far. 


* [Learn & Get Back live - Margaret Glaspy](https://youtu.be/ZV1lN2XFZTo?si=PiQQ4NSliDNyUufn&t=556)

	 Margaret has such a powerful voice! And to have busted out this album in just 3 days using a lot of first takes and rehearsal takes captures a rawness. "I don't like to be in the studio for long. I like to take a photo of the song and where the performance is at, and then get out as fast as possible." Act Natural is so great too. 


* [1974 - McDonalds Jingle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEBCV0ic6Tc)

	 "Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and a sesame seed bun."



* [RITUAL (evocation) - Jon Hopkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nmwxYmg-Gs)

	 A giant of a tune. The 30th of August album launch is a long time to wait... but I'll be here waiting!


* [Loved - Four Tet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W8Ei3ZUsEA)

	 Late night walking home through the pre-dawn mist and then discovering that you can see sound vibes. Daydream Repeat is dancy whilst somewhat cloudy. Nice album. 


* [The Flat and Paper Sky - Feldspar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VePQN8Nr9P8)

	 The bass in the choir is lush! Randomly refound this band and still heartbroken for them that they can make such fab music and have so little a following. 


* [Blessin' Me - Red Hearse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr6CVkPDpXQ)

	 Always a nice surprise to find old music by an artist. Red Hearse have made a glorious album. And the chord progressions in Blessin' Me and [Half Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlN6QNiZkKc) are 100% Bleachers! (Read Hearse the song sounds a lot like Young Fathers). I love the look of the live performances - for a fully electronic band, it's very [raw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVXUhKW92lc) and [improvised](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPyFyWzMFWo). 


* [Reckless - St. Vincent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIxfVno3wmI)

	 The crash beat towards the end is awesome!


* [Avant Gardener - Courtney Barnett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDdhzooFz4E)

	 The lyrics on this track are fire.


* [we fell in love in october - girl in red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWc0qtwO1oI)

	 This song pops up on playlists every now and then and I'm reminded how much I love it - especially the muted guitar tone.


* [Wet - Dazey and the Scouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnf9c6wyxRw)

	 Punk with a 50s vibe.


* [Lunch - Billie Eilish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCgWlgOoDaU)

	 A proper earworm.


* [effortlessly - Loops & Loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg7Bf-2pou8)

	 Gorgeously rich tones on this... it sounds effortless. 


* [Tales From The Loop (solo piano version) - Philip Glass & Paul Leonard-Morgan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFS_93qK1qE)

	 The soundtrack envokes a beautiful melancholia and the new solo piano version is the ultimate take on it. Another contender for most-listened to album of the year already.


* [A Shared Sense Of Purpose - Warrington Runcorn New Town Development Plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMhN3pWyBR0)

	 Truly gutted to have discovered there's a gig in Edinburgh on the day that the gig is happening and I can't go. :( This album is a work of art. 


* [HELLO - ATARASHII GAKKO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhUmjzX27N8)

	 Punky J-Pop.
