<p>Recently I've been meaning to write a post about eating insects and how it's likely to feature in our lives in the future... but I've not really had the time to put down some constructive thoughts. It's appeared in quite a few tv shows and blog posts recently and I definitely am fine with the idea - mostly I just found the idea of <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1682707/this-protein-bar-contains-25-crickets-and-you-can-try-it-out">protein-rich</a> <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/exoprotein/exo-protein-bars-made-from-cricket-flour">cereal bars</a> exciting (and surprisingly tasty sounding). I'm not really up for <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1673117/a-kit-to-grow-bugs-at-home-to-eat">farming my own</a>, not initially at least, but if I could buy frozen or dried bug powder/mince/chips then I'd totally be up for cooking with them. What do you think?</p>
