<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JanelleCShane">Janelle Shane</a> has been using a <a href="http://lewisandquark.tumblr.com/post/159176882762/in-which-the-neural-network-gets-bored-halfway">neural network</a> that she's trained to generate cookbook recipes. When Janelle shared the ingredients for "Chocolate Baked And Serves" on Twitter I thought it looked like a plausible list of ingredients - even with the addition of horseradish.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chocolate Baked And Serves<br />
cookies, deserts</p>
<p>1 cup butter<br />
2 cup peanut butter<br />
1 cup sugar<br />
1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />
3  eggs<br />
1 teaspoon baking powder<br />
1 cup white cocoa<br />
1 cup milk<br />
1 cup horseradish or sour cream</p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">There might be something in this (quantities aside!) - horseradish/wasabi in a peanut chocolate cookie/cake COULD work, right? <a href="https://t.co/XsNe6GVEJ8">https://t.co/XsNe6GVEJ8</a></p>

<p>And so it began...</p>

<p>I followed the recipe as much as I could - not having white cocoa powder I used regular stuff and when I got to the milk it was clear that milk was going to push the consistency of this recipe over the edge so I missed it out...</p>

<p>Here's the result, baked in both cookie and cake format:</p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-3065" src="http://ellis.scot/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170503_220413-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="495" /></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-3063" src="http://ellis.scot/uploads/2017/05/IMG_20170504_200039-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="495" /></p>
<p>And you know what? It made a damn fine cake. Cookies were of passible consistency but it's definitely more of a cake mixture. The horseradish is a subtle background flavour and the overall spicy, peanut-y, chocolate-y flavour is ace.</p>
<p>Thanks Janelle... and thank you to the neural network for being so creative!</p>
