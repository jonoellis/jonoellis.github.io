![An orange graffiti fish with three teeth drawn on a sticker](https://ellis.scot/uploads/2025/2025-08-02-fish.jpg)


Namur. Art Deco and Belle Epoque buildings (many in ruins), a warren of Citadel tunnels, a strawberry museum, gorgeous riversides, a funicular and a big interest in VR/AR/digital storytelling. Some graffiti, stickerslaps and murals - loved spotting the tiny guys by Isaac Cordal high up on buildings (and super hard for me to photograph with only a phone camera!). The C&A car park had some amazing works but also had a very high level of sketchy stuff going on outside with some kind of five-way argument involving snarling dogs and smashing bottles. Not sure who does the three toothed fish but one of their bigger pieces looked grand - nice to spot a wee sticker under a bridge too.
